Data Ecosystem Automation

RPA Automation for all the TBS Policy Instruments: https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/hierarch-eng.aspx (except 12 from different sources)

This is a small RPA Automation using UiPath. In the ".Objects\" folder you will find 3 important artifacts

1) LIST of English and French Policies ".Objects\PolicyInstruments.xlsx”,
2) Log file from the automation “.Objects\Runtime_Log.txt”.
3) The collected data in .CSV format

Everything is stored in the relative path to ease running the automation on your machine.
