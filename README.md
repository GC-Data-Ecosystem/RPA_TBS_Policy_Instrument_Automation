RPA Automations for the Data Ecosystem

This is a small RPA Automation usiing UiPath
The list of English and French Policies is found in the project folders \.objects\PolicyInstruments.xlsx
There are 2 'Write CSV' components that are currently saving the .CSV files to my filepath: "D:\UiPathWorkspace\Data_EcoSystem\"
In the interim, please change the write filepath until automation is migrated to the Cloud for orchestration
