Text version: Relationship between departmental chart of accounts elements and government-wide chart of accounts classifications

3.3 The departmental chart of accounts line object element enables the classification of financial transactions into accounting categories and provides additional detail about the type of goods or services acquired, the transfer payments made, the source of receipts or the cause of increases or decreases in assets and liabilities.

3.4 The Standard on Recording Financial Transactions in the Departmental Chart of Accounts requires that the departmental chart of accounts line object element must:

Aggregate to the object classification in the Government-wide Chart of Accounts for Canada (object codes).
Correlate to the financial reporting element in the departmental chart of accounts (and thus identify the financial reporting account level 5.)
Correlate to the list of common line objects established by Treasury Board Secretariat."
4. Definitions,Definitions to be used in the interpretation of this guideline are in Appendix A of the Standard on Recording Financial Transactions in the Departmental Chart of Accounts.
5. Departmental Guidance,"5.1 Line Objects are derived from valid combinations of financial reporting account and object codes from the Government-wide Chart of Accounts for Canada.

5.2 The list of common line objects is based on combinations of financial reporting accounts and object codes that all departments can use. Departments must ensure that their departmental line objects correlate to those in the list of common line objects.

5.3 The list is not all inclusive. It excludes combinations of financial reporting account and object codes:

Which are not widely used, based on an analysis of the current line object codes of several departments.
Where the financial reporting account or the object code are department specific (as noted in the Government-Wide Chart of Accounts.)

5.4 As appropriate, departments may:

Define additional departmental line objects correlating to combinations of financial reporting accounts and object codes not included in the list of common line objects.
Define more than one departmental line object for a single common line object, provided that this lower level of detail aggregates to the related common line object.

5.5 The list of common line objects will be updated periodically. Any additions, deletions or changes to the list of common line objects will be considered by the Office of the Comptroller General, in consultation with the Receiver General. "
