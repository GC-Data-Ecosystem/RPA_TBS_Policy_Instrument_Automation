3.4
A three-wave approach to the updated disclosure requirements of Gs&Cs information is being adopted to permit departments and agencies to make the necessary adjustments to business processes. Information on these waves can be found in Appendix G."
4. Context,"4.1

On October 21, 2005, the Government of Canada announced its commitment to proactively disclose the awarding of Gs&Cs worth more than $25,000 as part of its management improvement agenda. At the time, this commitment was part of the continued, phased introduction of proactive disclosure requirements that started with travel and hospitality expenses, contracts for goods and services, and position reclassification information.

In June 2016, as part of the Open Government Action Plan, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) committed to increasing the transparency and usefulness of Gs&Cs data. The initiative was spearheaded by a TBS-led committee of 37 participating departments, agencies and Crown corporations, now known as the Committee on the Reporting of Grants and Contributions Awards

5.2.2
Departments should report all award amendments according to the guidelines in Appendix D.
5.2.3
When there are a series of amendments to an award, they may be disclosed as one report, provided that they occur in the same reporting period.
5.2.4
When a grant or contribution is awarded and subsequently terminated, the termination should be treated as an amendment and reported as such.
5.2.5
When information is classified, the non-sensitive information should be reported under the award reporting exercise; departments may batch the information to protect sensitive information. Additional information on batch reporting can be found in Appendix C.
5.3
Collection of Gs&Cs data
5.3.1
The data fields described in Appendix B were developed by the Committee on the Reporting of Grants and Contributions Awards, in consultation with key external and internal stakeholders, to enable departments to provide consistent, useful and usable information to the public. Departments are encouraged to follow the recommended approach for each data field and move toward the recommended reporting standards over time.
5.4
Publication of Gs&Cs awards
5.4.1
Using templates provided by TBS, departments and agencies are to report their respective Gs&Cs information on the open government website.
5.4.1.1
Departments will begin reporting on the effective date of these guidelines.
5.4.1.2
Departments will place text, provided by TBS, on their existing proactive disclosure pages to redirect interested parties to the open government website.
5.4.2
When a department issues a grant or contribution on another department’s behalf, the department issuing the funds to the recipient should report the award and note that another department participated in the “additional information” field.
5.4.3
When more than one department or agency is funding a recipient for a shared initiative, both departments should report the award and the amount of the grant or contribution awarded by their department. Departments should communicate to ensure consistency of information, and include the name(s) of the other department(s) in the “additional information field”.
5.4.4
A Gs&Cs award or amendment that is not reported during the reporting period in which it was awarded may be indicated in the subsequent reporting period, or as soon as practical. Any belated reporting must be identified as such in the additional information field.
5.4.5
Posted information may be modified when a material error (defined in Appendix D) was made in the originally reported data. Any modified information should be clearly indicated within the original report’s additional information field.
5.4.6
Departments should provide a nil report for any quarter in which no Gs&Cs award or amendment are disclosed. Departments should populate the reporting period and the nil report data elements within the reporting template.
5.4.6.1
Departments should complete nil reports until one calendar year has passed since their last Gs&Cs award or amendment was reported.
5.5
Monitoring of award reporting
5.5.1
In accordance with the Treasury Board Policy on Transfer Payments, departments and agencies are responsible for ensuring that the Gs&Cs authority (the minister of the relevant department or agency) is acting and seen to be acting within the letter and the spirit of the Treasury Board Policy on Transfer Payments.
5.5.2
A department runs the risk of non-compliance if it does not ensure that Gs&Cs award and amendment information is accurate, up to date, and posted in accordance with the Policy on Transfer Payments and the Directive on Transfer Payments. The department’s deputy head is responsible for ensuring that data is appropriately validated, complete, and reported in a timely manner. It is a best practice for departments to clearly indicate any limitations associated with their reported data.
5.5.3
TBS will regularly monitor departmental data for Gs&Cs award reporting and ensure compliance. When a department does not have awards to disclose, it will populate a different section of the reporting template, and the information will be placed on the open government website."
