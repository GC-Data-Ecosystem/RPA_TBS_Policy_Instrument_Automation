3. Definitions,Definitions to be used in the interpretation of this guideline are listed in the Appendix.
4. Principles,"The Government of Canada, for the most part, underwrites its own risks and does not purchase insurance in the commercial insurance market. ""Underwriting"" risk requires the following:

thorough risk analysis;
acceptance of risk; and
identification of all financial options in order to ensure that losses can be funded if they occur.

Underwriting risk is the responsibility of each department, much in the same manner as is practising risk management under the Framework for the Management of Risk. The term ""self-insurance"" refers to the practice of each department funding its own losses. An important distinction is that ""self-insurance"" connotes a business approach to loss funding, namely that the Department acts as if it were its own insurer by:

understanding the nature of the risk;
making funds readily available in the event of a loss; and
having controls in place to reduce the financial impact once the loss has occurred.

The Government of Canada may, from time to time, exercise the option to purchase insurance in the commercial insurance market to finance certain risks. Examples of these exceptions to the practice of self-insurance include the following:

Operations in foreign jurisdictions that face mandatory requirements for insurance coverage, such as the operation of motor vehicles;
The interests of the Government co-mingled with those of other parties and the purchase of insurance constitutes an economy of scale that effectively protects all parties (e.g., Public Private Partnerships); and
Insurance coverage provided as part of expertise in service contracts, such as removal (e.g., moving and transfer) services for employees' personal property."
5. Management practices,"Managers are responsible for analyzing financial risks when considering the purchase of insurance, pursuant to the Principles section of this guideline and the Framework of the Management of Risk. In such cases, a cost-benefit analysis should be carried out in order to validate the decision to purchase insurance. Note that Order in Council 1030, issued in 1881, stated that it is a ""wise economy for the government to underwrite its own risks, as well as on moveable as on immoveable property... and no new ones effected"". In 1927, this Order in Council was extended to include ""automobiles etc"".

Acquisition of commercial insurance

5.1 In cases where managers have determined that the purchase of insurance presents an effective risk underwriting strategy and value for money, managers should ensure that:

legal services are consulted, in order to identify any legal implications arising from the purchase of insurance and whether or not doing so creates any potential liabilities for Canada;
other government departments with similar requirements are consulted so that any opportunities for insurance coverage and cost sharing are explored; and
officials of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) are consulted for guidance on the insurance procurement and management process.

5.2 For additional guidance on insurance coverage for fleet-managed vehicles, note that the Guide to Fleet Management, Chapter 1: Light Duty Vehicles and Guide to Fleet Management, Chapter 2: Executive Vehicles apply.

For additional direction on insurance coverage for employees and vehicles while on government business travel, note that the National Joint Council Travel Directive applies."
6. Roles and responsibilities of other organizations,"This section identifies other significant departments with respect to this guideline. In and of itself, it does not confer any authority.

6.1 The Department of Justice Canada is responsible for providing advice regarding government responsibilities and legal obligations where proposed investments, actions or policies might result in serious exposure in situations of risk.
