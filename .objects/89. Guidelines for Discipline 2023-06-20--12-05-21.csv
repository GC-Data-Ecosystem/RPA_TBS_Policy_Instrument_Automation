1. Context,"These guidelines replace the Guidelines for Discipline issued on April 1, 2005.

Paragraph 12(1)(c) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA) authorizes every deputy head in the core public administration to establish standards of discipline and to set penalties, including termination of employment, suspension, demotion to a position at a lower maximum rate of pay, and financial penalties that may be applied for breaches of discipline or misconduct. Subsection 12(3) provides, among other things, that disciplinary action shall be for cause. Finally subsection 12.2(1) permits delegation of these authorities.

These guidelines support the principles set out in the Policy Framework for People Management by providing advice that will foster sound people management practices across the core public administration."
2. Target Audience and Purpose,"These guidelines assist human resources advisors in the core public administration in their role of providing advice and guidance to management in the application of discipline, in the development of departmental codes of discipline, and in the conduct of disciplinary investigations and hearings.

The nature of discipline is to be corrective, rather than punitive, and its purpose is to motivate employees to accept those rules and standards of conduct that are desirable or necessary to achieve the organization's goals and objectives."
3. General,"Under subsection 12.2(1) of the FAA, management is responsible and accountable for the imposition of discipline. Typically, the level of management involved is commensurate with the severity of the disciplinary measure. Managers can be referred by human resources advisors to the guidance provided in Appendix A and can consult with their human resources advisor, their labour relations specialist, or both at the earliest indication that misconduct may have occurred. Furthermore, management can refer to the following website devoted to performance management.

It is recommended that codes of discipline developed by human resources advisors or management be based on sound managerial practices. When new codes of discipline or any significant amendments to an existing code are developed, a draft copy may be forwarded to the Treasury Board Secretariat's (TBS's) Employer Representation in Recourse Section for consultation before promulgation.

Upon request, TBS's Employer Representation in Recourse Team is available to provide advice and guidance on termination of employment or demotion or other disciplinary actions. "
4. Definitions - Disciplinary measures,"In order of increasing severity, disciplinary measures are as follows:

oral reprimand (réprimande verbale)

A verbal disciplinary measure that includes a statement outlining to the employee the nature of the misconduct, the corrective action required, and the consequences should it not be corrected. No record of this measure is placed on the employee's personnel file.

written reprimand (réprimande écrite)

A formal written notice that misconduct has occurred. It outlines the nature of the misconduct, the corrective action required, and the consequences should it not be corrected. If more severe disciplinary action should later become necessary, the record of the reprimand or reprimands on the personnel file demonstrates that the employee was made aware of the consequences of further misconduct.

suspension (suspension)

The temporary removal of the employee from the place of work without pay as a consequence of misconduct. The notice of suspension includes the nature of the misconduct, the corrective action required, and the consequences should it not be corrected.

financial penalty (sanction pécuniaire)

An alternative to a suspension, where a financial penalty is considered preferable for operational or economic reasons. Financial penalties are appropriate in situations involving mass unlawful withdrawal of services, continuous shift operations, ships at sea, or isolated posts where it may be difficult to schedule suspensions without the use of replacements and overtime. It may also be used to impose a definitive disciplinary measure for an act of misconduct. The notice of financial penalty outlines the nature of the misconduct, the corrective measure required, and the consequences should it not be corrected.

demotion (rétrogradation)

An action taken by the employer to appoint an employee to a position at a lower maximum rate of pay. Demotion is an alternative to a disciplinary termination and may be used when the manager is of the opinion that, despite the misconduct, the employee is still suitable for continued employment, albeit in a position at a lower maximum rate of pay. Demotion could be used in situations where a manager is found guilty of harassment and is moved to a position with no managerial responsibilities.

termination (licenciement)

The separation of an employee from the core public administration for misconduct. Termination may be used after a series of acts of misconduct when a culminating incident has occurred or for a single act of serious misconduct. Termination is the most severe disciplinary measure, and the decision to proceed is taken only after careful consideration and when it is determined that the employee is no longer suitable for continued employment by reason of misconduct."
5. Redress,"An employee who is disciplined as described in these guidelines is entitled to present an individual grievance at each of the levels in the grievance process, up to and including the final level, under the Public Service Labour Relations Board Regulations and the provisions of any applicable collective agreement. Individual grievances may also be subject to third-party adjudication, under paragraph 209(1)(b) of the Public Service Labour Relations Act."
