1. Preface,"1.1 A more efficient and responsive public service

The Common Services Policy sets a strategic direction and provides authority to reform administrative management and the role of common service organizations (CSO) to create a more streamlined, efficient, and responsive Public Service.

The government's White Paper on Public Service 2000, ""The Renewal of the Public Service of Canada"" (December 1990), describes the need for fundamental changes in the structure and management of the Public Service. These changes are necessary to equip federal public service employees for the 21st century and to enable them to function effectively in the context of continuing restraint.

The white paper sets clear directions for the provision of common services to assist program delivery:

The government will make optional as many common services as possible, maintaining mandatory services only where there is an overriding reason. To this end, the Treasury Board will review all mandatory common services to determine how they can become optional in a cost-effective manner.

Changes in the regimes for administrative policies and common services offer clear potential for streamlining, saving time and money, and giving more choice and flexibility to line managers. The white paper states the following:

With respect to administrative policies, central agencies, common service agencies, and departments will be expected to:

delegate authority as close as possible to the levels in the organization delivering the services to clients;
deregulate policies to ensure that managers and employees have more authority to provide services and be accountable for their performance; and
assist managers to develop the necessary knowledge and skills to use this increased authority.
1.2 Responding to a new environment

The government has used CSOs to obtain advantages from economies of scale and to seek benefits from the pooling of specialized expertise. In some instances, CSOs offer the convenience of one-stop shopping for departments and a single window to the government for private contractors. In other instances, CSOs provide government-wide repositories of information or offer the potential of fulfilling other government objectives.

These benefits must be weighed against other considerations in the current environment, such as the global costs of central supply; the widespread use of information technology in administration, purchasing, and communications; and the existence of a highly competitive and accessible marketplace.

As the demand increases for more streamlined, responsive, and cost-effective government operations, it may sometimes be more efficient for clients to have access to alternative sources of supply, including dealing directly with private sector suppliers.

1.3 Choice and competition

Optional services are based upon the dual principles of user choice and user pay. There are strong incentives for managers to be fiscally responsible when they have choice over the acquisition of goods and services and when costs are visible and billed directly to their operating budgets. Such an environment promotes quality management practices and accountability for operating efficiently among line departments. It gives them greater control and flexibility over the costs of their operation to best carry out their mission of service to the public.

Giving departments and agencies increased choice in how to meet their requirements promotes innovation and successful program delivery, particularly with respect to addressing unique mandates and operational requirements or to capitalizing on new opportunities.

Choice for line departments creates a competitive environment for CSOs. In a competitive environment, where CSOs operate on cost-recovery, market pressures cause the CSOs to focus on customer service, providing quality goods and services on time, and pricing competitively. This allows them to retain market share and operate a viable service organization. The CSOs have a natural interest in operating efficiently and being innovative in service delivery in order to remain viable and satisfy customer requirements. Such an environment contributes to increased opportunities for commercial suppliers to serve government where this provides best value and generally promotes more efficient and less costly government operations.

The philosophy promoted by this policy reflects international trends in the public and private sectors.

This policy is based on managers exercising sound judgment and authority, managing risk, and assuming clear accountability for their performance and results. It provides an accountability framework consistent with these expectations. Included is an accountability of departments to negotiate delegation instruments with CSOs or to seek exemptions from Treasury Board policies when these would better support the achievement of policy objectives.

1.4 Mandatory service reviews

The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and CSOs will use the principles set out in this policy to conduct an intensive review of the mandatory services listed in Appendix E. Departments will be consulted about these reviews."
2. Policy objective,"The objective of this policy is to ensure that departments and agencies can acquire responsive, cost-effective support for their program delivery."
3. Policy statement,"CSOs will offer services to client departments in a manner that is most supportive of timely, effective, and economical delivery of programs to the public.

The government will make optional as many common services as possible, maintaining mandatory services only where there is an overriding reason. To this end, the Treasury Board will review all mandatory common services. If there is not an overriding reason to maintain their mandatory status, the Treasury Board will determine how the services can become optional in a cost-effective manner.

Departments may obtain optional services from a CSO on a negotiated basis."
4. Application,"This policy applies to the departments and agencies (hereinafter referred to as departments) listed in schedules I, I.1, and II of the Financial Administration Act and to commissions of inquiry designated as departments for purposes of the Act."
5. Policy requirements,"5.1 Use of mandatory services

Departments must use mandatory services (listed in Appendix E of this policy) to meet their requirements.

5.2 Flexibility and delegation of authority

CSOs that offer services that are mandatory under Treasury Board policy (as opposed to legislation) must deliver these services in a manner that allows and facilitates the maximum flexibility and delegation of authority to the departments they serve.

5.3 Compliance with policies and standards

CSOs must comply with all government and Treasury Board policies and standards when providing common services. Departments must comply with the same policies and standards when they exercise direct authorities provided under this policy to meet their requirements for goods and services, including when they obtain delegation of authority from a CSO for mandatory services.

5.4 Proposals for changes in status

All proposals to change the status of common services must be presented to the Treasury Board for approval. Access by regional suppliers to government departments is to be included among the issues considered to support such proposals.

To avoid duplication and overlap and to permit an orderly phasing out of services to be terminated, departments must obtain Treasury Board approval to terminate existing mandatory or optional services, establish new services, or carry out services that individual departments now undertake.

5.5 Exemptions from this policy

Treasury Board approval is required when a department wishes to discontinue using all or part of a service that is mandatory under Treasury Board policy (as opposed to being mandatory through legislation).

In seeking exemptions from the Treasury Board respecting the use of services that are mandatory under Treasury Board policy (as opposed to legislation), departments must submit a business case to the Treasury Board that presents the anticipated advantages of granting an exemption.

5.6 Funding of common services provided by CSOs

As a guiding principle, mandatory services provided by CSOs are funded mainly through appropriation, and optional services are funded mainly by full cost-recovery through a revolving fund or net-voting authority. Mandatory services must not subsidize optional services.

For those mandatory services not funded by appropriation, rates charged to departments must be set to recover but not exceed the full costs of providing each specific service. All appropriate measures must be taken to reduce these costs to a minimum.

Unless otherwise directed by the minister responsible, where optional services are funded by a revolving fund, rates charged to departments must recover the full costs of the CSO in order to break even at the level of the overall operation over a reasonable period of time, such as the planning period for the CSO. Rates for a specific optional service, however, may be set by the CSO at competitive market rates.

CSOs must obtain Treasury Board approval for the rates to be charged to client departments for optional services and those mandatory services that are not funded by appropriation, except where the Treasury Board has authorized the CSO to set its rates directly.

5.7 Services to Crown corporations and non-federal organizations

A CSO may negotiate special arrangements to offer services to Crown corporations or non-federal organizations, provided that it is consistent with the mandate of the CSO, subject to the following conditions:

specific approval of the minister responsible for the CSO is obtained with respect to the policy rationale and the proposed scope (i.e. markets to be served) and terms (e.g. pricing, service line, and business volume) of the special arrangements;
rates charged for services will recover but not exceed the full cost of the services provided; and
providing services to Crown corporations or non-federal organizations will not interfere with the CSO's primary role, which is to provide services to federal departments.
5.8 Authority to compete

The following CSO is authorized to engage in the competitive process to serve departments. Bids from this organization, when submitted, must be considered by departments at the same time as private sector bids and must be handled in the same manner:

Canada School of Public Service for the provision of training consulting services."
6. Responsibilities,"The accountability framework described in Appendix A of this policy specifies the respective roles and responsibilities of CSOs, departments, and the Treasury Board for implementing the Common Services Policy.
