Also excluded is customer information from transactions that are completed through a cash payment (including credit cards), where no billing or accounts receivable is established, and no specific customer information is maintained in the departmental financial and materiel management system.

This standard is issued pursuant to section 7 and 9 of the Financial Administration Act.
