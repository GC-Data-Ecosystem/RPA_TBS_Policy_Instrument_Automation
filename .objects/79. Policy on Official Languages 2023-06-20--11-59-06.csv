1. Effective Date,"1.1 This policy takes effect on November 19, 2012 and replaces the Official Languages Policy Framework, the Policy on the Use of Official Languages for Communications with and Services to the Public, the Policy on Language of Work, and the Policy on Official Languages for Human Resources Management."
2. Application,"2.1 This policy applies to all institutions that are subject to Parts IV (Communications with and Services to the Public), V (Language of Work), VI (Participation of English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians) and section 91 (Staffing) of the Official Languages Act (OLA), with the exception of the Senate, the House of Commons, the Library of Parliament, the office of the Senate Ethics Officer, and the office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. In places, this Policy also refers to Part VII (Advancement of English and French) of the OLA, given the close links between official languages obligations for institutions that are found in Parts IV, V, VI and VII. Requirements under this policy apply, however, only to institutions subject to Parts IV, V and VI and section 91 of the OLA."
3. Context,"3.1 The Official Languages Act (OLA) is based on the Constitution Act of 1867 and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter). Its quasi-constitutional status has been recognized by the Canadian courts.

3.2 The OLA reaffirms the equality of status of English and French as the official languages of Canada and establishes equal rights and privileges as to their use in institutions. The OLA sets out the obligations of institutions with regard to official languages. The Official Languages (Communications with and Services to the Public) Regulations (the Regulations) define the scope of certain provisions of the OLA with respect to communications with and services to the public.

3.3 The OLA defines the responsibilities and duties of the Treasury Board in the area of official languages. They include providing the general direction and coordination for the policies and programs of the Government of Canada of the parts of the OLA relating to the implementation of communications with and services to the public, language of work and the equitable participation of English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians in institutions.

3.4 The OLA also defines the responsibilities and duties of the Minister of Canadian Heritage in the area of official languages. This role relates to the obligation of institutions to adopt positive measures in order to support the development of English and French linguistic minority communities and advance the equality of status and use of the English and French languages within Canadian society.

3.5 Deputy heads exercise key leadership in their institutions in the area of official languages. Leadership in official languages means meeting the requirements under this policy and its related directives in an effective and timely fashion.  It also means combining a clear understanding of the letter and spirit of the entire OLA with an understanding of the challenges and opportunities that the mandate and context of an institution affords in official languages matters. As a result, respecting the public's and employees’ language rights, considering the needs of official language minority communities and seizing opportunities for promoting both languages in Canadian society become integral parts of institutional practice.

3.6 An important element in achieving results for Canadians and employees in the area of official languages is institutional bilingualism. Institutional bilingualism is the result of appropriate staffing processes as well as an investment by the institution in employees’ language training and development, and the availability of adequate technological and other material resources.

3.7 Treasury Board Secretariat and Canadian Heritage exercise coherent, government-wide leadership in official languages and collaborate to allow for better reporting and communication of results to Canadians. The Accountability and Coordination Framework for Official Languages (2003) defines the responsibilities for horizontal coordination and inter-departmental cooperation.  The framework also sets out approaches for implementation across institutions.

3.8 The Treasury Board is issuing this policy pursuant to its authority under section 46 of the OLA.

3.9 This policy must be read in conjunction with the Charter, the OLA, in particular, Parts IV, V, VI, VII and Section 91 as well as its Regulations. It must also be read in conjunction with the following policy instruments, where such instruments are applicable to a given institution:

Foundation Framework for Treasury Board Policies
Policy Framework for People Management
Directive on Official Languages for Communications and Services
Directive on Official Languages for People Management
Directive on the Implementation of the Official Languages (Communications with and Services to the Public) Regulations

3.10 Additional requirements are set out in the following instruments, where applicable to each institution:

Qualification Standards in Relation to Official Languages
Bilingualism Bonus Directive
Public Service Official Languages Exclusion Approval Order and the Public Service Official Languages Appointment Regulations"

5.2.4 Appropriate governance structures, mechanisms, and resources are in place to ensure coherent management of the institution’s official languages obligations."
6. Policy Requirements,"6.1 Official Languages Governance

6.2.1 (Active offer) The institution actively offers communications with and services to the public at designated offices in both official languages.

Deputy heads ensure that:

6.4.1 (Employment and advancement) The institution provides English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians with equal opportunities for employment and advancement.

evaluate why the requirements of this policy and its supporting instruments have not been respected;
take corrective action and report back on results.

7.3 Any failure to comply with this policy or its supporting instruments, or with corrective actions requested by OCHRO-TBS, may give rise to:

The annual report by the President of the Treasury Board reports on results under Parts IV, V and VI while the annual report by Canadian Heritage reports on results under Part VII of the OLA.
