This standard supports consistent and comparable vendor information on a government-wide basis for organizations or individuals that enter into financial arrangements in order to supply goods or services to the Government of Canada (GC), or for organizations or individuals for which an accounts payable will be established by the GC. The information maintained in the vendor record is used to support procurement, payment and reporting on business interactions with the GC.

The minimum mandatory structure for the vendor record is composed of the following data elements: vendor legal name; vendor category; vendor identification number; vendor address; vendor city; vendor region; vendor country; vendor postal code; vendor language preference; vendor tax recipient type, vendor tax identification  number; and vendor banking information.

Excluded from this standard is vendor information related to one-time vendor transactions. Also excluded is vendor information from transactions that are completed through a cash payment (including credit cards), where no accounts payable is established, and no specific vendor information is maintained in the departmental financial and materiel management system.

This standard is issued pursuant to section 7 and 9 of the Financial Administration Act.

This standard is to be read in conjunction with the Policy on the Stewardship of Financial Management Systems, and Directive on Account Verification.
