1. Effective date,"1.1
This directive comes into effect on August 23, 2022.
1.2
This directive replaces the following instruments:
The 2012 Directive on the Implementation of the Official Languages (Communications with and Services to the Public) Regulations;
The 2016 amendment to the Directive on the Implementation of the Official Languages (Communications with and Services to the Public) Regulations."
2. Application,"2.1
This directive applies to all institutions subject to the Official Languages Act (OLA), including departments, agencies, Crown corporations, and privatized organizations that are subject to incorporating legislation or any other legislation that contains provisions that subject them to the OLA, except for the Senate, the House of Commons, the Library of Parliament, the Office of the Senate Ethics Officer, and the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner."
3. Context,"3.1
The OLA is based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The OLA reaffirms the equality of status of English and French as the official languages of Canada, and establishes equal rights and privileges as to their use in the institutions of the Government of Canada. The OLA sets out the obligations of institutions with regard to official languages. The Official Languages (Communications with and Services to the Public) Regulations (the Regulations) implement subsection 20(1) of the Charter and some of the key sections of Part IV of the OLA regarding communications with and services to the public. The Regulations specify the circumstances under which the “nature” of the office justifies the provision of bilingual services, and set criteria to determine whether there is significant demand for services in both official languages. Most of the provisions of the Regulations aiming to determine whether there is significant demand in an office require the use of data from the most recent decennial census or the presence of minority language primary or secondary public educational facilities.
3.2
This directive supports the Policy on Official Languages by covering various operational aspects associated with the implementation of the Regulations, namely:
The time frame for an office automatically designated bilingual, under a provision related to the nature of the office or to significant demand, to implement the measures enabling the office to fulfill its language obligations;
The time frame for an office to define its service area;
The applicable terms and conditions for demographic protection;
The time allotted to an institution to measure demand for services in both official languages and the associated terms and conditions;
The time frame for an office designated bilingual, after demand has been measured, to implement the measures enabling the office to fulfill its language obligations;
The cycle for updating the language designation of offices subject to provisions related to specific circumstances;
The cycle for updating the language designation of offices subject to provisions related to the presence, in their service area, of a minority language primary or secondary public educational facility;
The terms and conditions and the transition period that apply to offices that are no longer required to provide services in both official languages; and
A clear definition of what constitutes a service area, a minority language public educational facility, demographic protection, as well as restricted and identifiable clientele.
3.3
This directive helps federal institutions comply with the Regulations. The directive enables the Government of Canada to reduce the risks of legal complaints due to the failure of institutions to respect the rights of the public to communicate with and receive services from these institutions in the official language of the public’s choice.
3.4
This directive is issued by the Treasury Board pursuant to section 46 of the OLA.
3.5
This directive must be read in conjunction with Part IV of the OLA, its Regulations, the Policy on Official Languages and the Directive on Official Languages for Communications and Services."
4. Definitions,Refer to the Appendix of this directive.
5. Directive statement,"5.1
Objective
The purpose of this directive is to ensure, while respecting the spirit of the Charter and the OLA, a consistent and coherent implementation of the Regulations by specifying certain aspects.
5.2
Expected results
In situations where a measurement of demand for services must be conducted, institutions have determined the language designation according to the methods and the time frames prescribed in this directive;
In situations where the principle of proportionality applies, institutions have determined the number of designated bilingual offices according to the requirements of the Regulations and of this directive, and have consulted the linguistic minority population about which office location or locations should be designated bilingual;
