1. Date of publication,"This guide takes effect on August 1, 2020.

This guide replaces the Guidance document: Proactive disclosure of travel and hospitality expenses, dated March 31, 2004."
2. Application,"This guide supports the requirements for the proactive publication of travel and hospitality expenses under the Access to Information Act and applies to government institutions that are subject to the Access to Information Act.

Government institutions should adopt all sections and requirements of this guide, as well as all sections and requirements of the following:

Access to Information Act
Privacy Act
Interim Policy on Privacy Protection
Policy on Access to Information
Interim Directive on the Administration of the Access to Information Act
Directive on Travel, Hospitality, Conference and Event Expenditures"
3. Objective,This guide will help ensure that information on government travel and hospitality expenses is proactively published in accordance with statutory obligations. Proactive publication provides consistent information that is accessible to the public.
4. Whose travel and hospitality expenses must be proactively published?,"Under the Access to Information Act, travel and hospitality expenses incurred by the following individuals must be proactively published in electronic form:

ministers (including the Prime Minister, ministers of state and associate ministers), ministerial advisers
Footnote
1 and ministerial staff
Footnote
2
senior officers or employees in any department or ministry of state of the Government of Canada, or in any body or office listed in Schedule I of the Access to Information Act, which includes government institutions listed in Schedules I, I.1, and II of the Financial Administration Act (including deputy ministers, deputy heads, associate deputy ministers, assistant deputy ministers, assistant deputy heads, and any individuals who hold positions of an equivalent rank)
senior officers or employees in any parent Crown corporation, and any wholly owned subsidiary of such a corporation, within the meaning of section 83 of the Financial Administration Act (including presidents, vice‑presidents, chief executive officers and members of a board of directors, and any individuals who hold positions of an equivalent rank)

Travel and hospitality expenses incurred by individuals on behalf of any person listed above must also be published.

It is up to the government institution to determine which positions constitute positions of an equivalent rank."
5. What information needs to be proactively published?,"5.1 What travel expense information needs to be proactively published?

Government institutions must publish the information in Table 1 for each trip taken by any individual listed in section 4 of this guide.

Table 1: information fields for travel expenses
Information field	Description


Notes

Amounts must be reported in Canadian dollars and include taxes.
Expense items should appear in chronological order according to the date(s) on which the travel expenses were reimbursed. For government institutions using the Open Government Portal, the most recently uploaded travel expenses will appear first.
Government institutions that have no travel expenses to report in a period (no travel expenses for the entire government institution) must submit a report that states “nothing to report” (known as a nil report). Institutions are not to publish nil reports for each individual who has no travel expenses for a publication period.
Expenses reimbursed by a third party: In situations where travel expenses are reimbursed by a third party, it is recommended that the government institution post, for example, a zero-dollar transaction and provide an explanation in the “Additional comments” field.
Companion travel: Companion travel expenses must be included in the travel expense disclosure of the individual subject to proactive publication. For example, when the spouse of a minister accompanies that minister on official government business, in accordance with the Policies for Ministers’ Offices, the travel expenses incurred by the spouse must be included in the minister’s travel expense claims and must be published. In such situations, the spouse’s presence on the trip is to be indicated in the “Purpose of travel” field (for example, “Attend state funeral: Accompanied by spouse”). Additional information could be added in the “Additional comments” field.
Dependant travel: Travel expenses for dependants can be claimed under very specific circumstances, which are set out in the National Joint Council Travel Directive. If dependant travel expenses are allowed, they should be included in the official’s travel claims and should be published. For example, the “Purpose of travel” field could be populated with “Weekend travel: Dependant” and additional information could be added in the “Additional comments” field.
Member of Parliament (MP) travel: Under the Policies for Ministers’ Offices and the Special Travel Authorities, MPs may, in some circumstances, accompany a minister as a guest or travel on a minister’s behalf. If the travel expenses incurred by an MP in such circumstances are charged to the minister’s budget, they should be published and would be indicated in the “Purpose of travel” field. Example: “Infrastructure Canada announcement: Accompanied by Joe Smith, MP” or “Infrastructure Canada announcement: Joe Smith, MP, on behalf of Minister Jones.”
Relocation: Travel expenses incurred for the purposes of relocation under the National Joint Council Relocation Directive are not subject to proactive publication.
Cancelled trips: The Access to Information Act requires the proactive publication of all travel expenses for the individuals listed in section 4 of this guide. As such, if residual travel expenses are still reflected in the government institution’s financial management system after the cancellation of a trip, they still have to be proactively published. The “Additional comments” field can be used to specify that the trip was cancelled and explain which costs were incurred.
Local travel: Travel expenses to be published include local travel within the normal office location and surrounding working area (for example, taxi and parking expenses).

** For all questions about interpreting financial policy, consult your chief financial officer.

Corrections and adjustments

Proactive publication should occur when the travel and hospitality expenses have been reimbursed (see the reimbursement criteria listed in section 7 of this guide).

The publication should not be delayed in anticipation of an adjustment to the information (such as a non-material cost that is charged long after the trip occurred or the hospitality was provided).

In the event of an error or adjustment in published information (for example, an additional unexpected processing fee or an interdepartmental settlement from another institution is charged after the travel expenses have been proactively published), government institutions must correct or adjust the published information as soon as possible."
7. What does reimbursement of travel and hospitality expenses mean?,"7.1 When are travel expenses considered reimbursed?

Under the Access to Information Act, any travel expenses incurred by an individual listed in section 4 of this guide must be proactively published within 30 days after the end of the month in which the travel expenses were reimbursed.

The reimbursement of travel expenses in the Government of Canada is complex for several reasons, including:

Travel expenses can take different forms, for example:
reimbursement of out‑of‑pocket expenses paid by an individual
prepaid expenses, such as airfare and hotel
allowances
advances
Travel expenses can be incurred at different times, for example:
before a trip (airfare and accommodations)
during a trip (meals and transportation)
Travel expenses can be paid in different ways, for example:
paid directly by the government institution
paid out of pocket by the individual and reimbursed later by the government institution

Because of these complexities, travel expenses are considered to have been reimbursed once all of the following have occurred:

the travel expense claim for the trip has been approved
all of the expenses related to the travel have been granted certification authority and payment authority (sections 34 and 33 of the Financial Administration Act) by the appropriate individuals with delegated authority
Footnote
3
all of the travel expenses are recorded in the government institution’s financial management system

Note that all related travel expenses must be published together once all of the expenses are reimbursed as described above.

Figure 1 is an example of how to determine when a travel expense must be published. The example:

is a timeline of the publication of travel expenses incurred by a senior officer or employee in a department
shows how the reimbursement of travel expenses triggers the deadline for proactive publication

7.2 When are hospitality expenses considered reimbursed?

Under the Access to Information Act, any hospitality expenses incurred by an individual listed in section 4 of this guide must be proactively published within 30 days after the end of the month in which the hospitality expenses were reimbursed.

The reimbursement of hospitality expenses in the Government of Canada is complex because these expenses can result from various payment methods (for example, invoices, acquisition cards and reimbursements of out‑of‑pocket expenses), which means that some expenses are paid directly by the government institution and some are reimbursed to individuals. In addition, a hospitality activity may include several hospitality expenses, for example expenses related to providing refreshments, lunch and dinner.

As a result, the detailed total cost of the hospitality activity must be published 30 days after the end of the month once both of the following actions have occurred:

all of the hospitality expenses related to the hospitality activity have been granted certification authority and payment authority (sections 34 and 33 of the Financial Administration Act) from the appropriate individuals with delegated authority
Footnote
3
all of the hospitality expenses related to the hospitality activity are recorded in the senior officer’s budget or the employee’s budget (responsibility centre) as a hospitality expense in the government institution’s financial management system

Government institutions must proactively publish all hospitality expenses that are related to an activity and that are charged to the responsibility centre that the senior officer or employee is directly managing, even if this individual did not attend the activity.

Figure 2 is an example of how to determine when a hospitality expense must be published. The example:

8. Where must travel and hospitality expenses be proactively published?,"The Access to Information Act:

requires that travel and hospitality expenses be published in electronic form
provides that the President of the Treasury Board, as designated Minister, may specify the form of the publication

Departments, agencies and other bodies subject to the Access to Information Act and listed in Schedules I, I.1, or II of the Financial Administration Act are required to proactively publish travel and hospitality expenditures on the Open Government Portal.

Crown corporations and wholly owned subsidiaries, and other government institutions subject to the Access to Information Act may proactively publish travel and hospitality expenditures on their own websites or on the Open Government Portal. Wholly owned subsidiaries publishing on a parent Crown corporation’s website should publish as clearly identifiable entities.

Information published on the Open Government Portal must be uploaded to the Open Government Registry the day before the deadline for proactive publication so that information can be published overnight to meet the legislated timeline for publication.

Contact open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca for information about the Open Government Portal."
9. Protecting what is not required or not permitted to be proactively published,"Pursuant to sections 80 and 90 of the Access to Information Act, when proactively publishing travel and hospitality expenses, an institution is required to not publish any information that would be required to be withheld if it were being disclosed in response to an access to information request. As well, an institution is not required to publish information that the institution could refuse to disclose in response to an access to information request. For example, the publication of travel and hospitality expenses is not required if the information would compromise national security, public safety or ongoing criminal investigations.

Government institutions should consult with their access to information coordinators for advice on whether specific information relating to government travel and hospitality expenses should be disclosed."
10. How is proactive publication monitored?,"Government institutions are responsible for ensuring that:

information about travel and hospitality expenses is accurate and up to date
