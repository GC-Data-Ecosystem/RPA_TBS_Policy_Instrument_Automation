3. Context,"3.1 The Government of Canada's commitment to open government is founded on the strong history of transparency and accountability first established with the enactment of the Access to Information Act in 1983 followed by the Federal Accountability Act in 2006 which introduced proactive disclosure. In 2012 the Government joined the Open Government Partnership and in June 2013 the Government endorsed the G8 Charter on Open Data.

3.2 The expectations of Canadians for increased access to, and the proactive release of, federal data and information will require government departments and agencies to make their information resources that are eligible for release to be more easily discoverable and reusable.

3.3 Strong information management practices are the cornerstone of the Government of Canada's open government activities. These practices increase efficiency, reduce costs, improve services, safeguard personal, classified and confidential information, and ensure the availability of high-quality, authoritative information, ultimately enabling departments to be more responsive and accountable to Canadians.

3.4 This directive supports the Policy on Information Management by promoting information management practices which enable the proactive and ongoing release of government information.

3.5 This directive is to be read in conjunction with the Directive on Recordkeeping and the Communications Policy of the Government of Canada. In addition, this directive will be reinforced by additional guidance, tools, and resources, including guidance on licences and release criteria.
