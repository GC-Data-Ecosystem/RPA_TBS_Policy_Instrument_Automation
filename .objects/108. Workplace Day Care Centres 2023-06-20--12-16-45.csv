Application,This policy applies to all departments and other portions of the Public Service listed in Part I of Schedule I of the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
Policy requirements,"General

1. The following conditions apply to every workplace day care centre (hereafter referred to as centre).

1.1 A centre must be associated with a lead department or a group of user departments -in which case one department must be chosen as the lead department -whose employees work in or near the workplace in question.

1.2 The total number of actual or proposed centres, including the one under active consideration, in the municipality or census subdivision as set out in the Geographic Location Master File (see references), must not exceed one for every 4,000 employees.

1.3 The centre must have the capacity to accommodate at least 30 children.

1.4 A centre must attempt to operate with all or most of its capacity used by children of employees. After the initial five years of operation, the rental subsidy calculation will be based on the percentage of children of employees using the centre. (See appendix B)

1.5 A centre must cost the employer no more than $400,000 (1991 dollars) to fit up the space it will occupy.

1.6 Before the fit-up of a centre, employee-parent volunteers must form a non-profit day care centre corporation (hereafter referred to as corporation) in accordance with the legislation that applies in the area where the centre will be located.

1.7 A centre must be entirely financially self-supporting, except for the federally subsidized fit-up and rent at full market rates, described in this policy. Federal funds will not be available for centres in financial difficulty.

1.8 Fit-up, rent and wrap-up costs must come from the existing financial resources of the relevant department(s). (See policy requirement 2.4)

1.9 A centre must strictly observe all the provisions of its licence agreement with the custodian department. (See policy requirement 3.6)

Lead department

2. The lead department must do the following:

2.1 Interested deputy heads reserve the option to proceed with the establishment of a centre by writing to the secretary of the Treasury Board.

The ten available options for new centres will be allotted on a ""first come, first served"" basis. Each option expires within six months unless the deputy minister writes to the secretary within that period, indicating that as a result of the economic viability assessment, a centre will be established. (See policy requirement 2.4)

2.2 Ensure that:

No other actual or proposed centre already serves any of the identified federal work force;
Requirements 1.2 and 1.3 are met.

2.3 Survey the identified federal workforce, including determining the official languages needs of interested employees (i.e. English, French, bilingual) and conduct a thorough financial analysis to establish whether current and future demands are sufficient for a centre to be viable.

2.4 Where the deputy head is satisfied that a centre is financially viable and that the department is willing to be the lead department, he or she advises the appropriate custodian department and the Secretary of the Treasury Board that the department agrees to:

be financially responsible for the fit-up of a centre;
cover the costs of preparing space for a new tenant should the centre close in the future; and
transfer to the custodian enough money to cover the rental subsidy or capital construction costs, where appropriate.

In the case of a group of departments, each deputy head must 'viability and agree to 'share of the money.

2.5 Compile and submit data for evaluation purposes as set out in appendix C.

The agreement must include provision for: payment of rent by the corporation of not less than that set out in appendix B and, if applicable, meeting the language requirements in appendix D.

Day care centre corporation

4.2 enter into a licence agreement with the custodian department for the use of the space allocated to the centre;

4.3 within the licence agreement, undertake to pay for utilities, cleaning and operating costs of the centre (excluding structural maintenance); and
