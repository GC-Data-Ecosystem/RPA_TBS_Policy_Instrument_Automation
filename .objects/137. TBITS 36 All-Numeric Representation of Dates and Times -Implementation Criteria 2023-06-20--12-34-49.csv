2. Purpose,"The purpose of this standard is to define the numeric format for calendar dates for the purpose of interchange of machine-readable data between departments and agencies.

The term ""Gregorian Date"", as frequently used in Electronic Data Processing parlance, is the equivalent of the term ""Calendar Date"" as used in this document, i.e. date format consisting of three numeric fields to represent year, month and day of month respectively.

The term ""Julian Date"", also frequently used in EDP parlance, is the equivalent of the term ""Ordinal Date"" as used in this document, i.e. date format consisting of two numeric fields, often conjoined, to represent year and sequential day within the year commencing with 001 for January 1st."
3. Application,This standard shall apply when describing either calendar or ordinal dates in an all-numeric form for interchange of machine-readable data between departments and agencies.
4. Qualifications,"4.1 Sequence

two digits to represent ""day""

4.3.2 An ordinal date consists of two elements:

three digits to represent ""day of the year""
4.4 Separators

For person-to-machine (input) or machine-to-person (output) purposes, as well as for person-to-person purposes, the calendar date may be edited by the inclusion of either of the separators space or hyphen to partition the elements, e.g.:

1975 07 01 (space separators)
