1. Effective Date,"1.1 This policy takes effect on September 1, 2008.

1.2 It replaces the Policy on the Indemnification of and Legal Assistance for Crown Servants of June 1, 2001."
2. Application,"2.1 This policy applies to Crown servants as defined in section 4 of this policy, and to all departments as defined in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA) and to the other portions of the federal public administration named in Schedule IV of the FAA, unless otherwise excluded through specific acts, regulations, or orders in council, and to the Canadian Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police."
3. Context,"3.1 Providing legal assistance and indemnification to Crown servants is essential to the protection of the Crown's interest, the fair treatment of its servants, and the effective management of an organization. Crown servants may be subject to legal claims/actions despite the fact that they are acting in good faith, within the scope of their duties or in the course of their employment. It is therefore necessary that they receive appropriate legal representation and be protected from personal liability as long as they are not acting against the interests of the Crown.

3.2 The greater public interest is served by obtaining the full collaboration of Crown servants in testifying in legal proceedings including parliamentary proceedings, commissions of inquiry, inquests or other similar proceedings. This policy is intended to encourage such collaboration.

3.3 This policy is issued pursuant to section 7 of the Financial Administration Act.

3.4 This policy reflects the values of the federal public service."

6. Policy Requirements,"6.1 Approval authorities are responsible for:

6.1.1 Decision making: Making decisions to approve or not approve requests for legal assistance and indemnification from Crown servants, within the scope of authority as set out in Appendix A. Decisions in respect to a request for legal assistance or indemnification are the responsibility of the approval authority for the organization where the incident giving rise to the request first arose.

6.1.2 Timely response: Ensuring timely responses to Crown servants who are requesting legal assistance or indemnification under this policy, and for ensuring that claims or threats of suits are acted upon quickly and that dispute resolution mechanisms are considered, as appropriate.

6.1.3 Eligibility: In making a decision on whether to approve a request for legal assistance or indemnification, ensuring that the Crown servant meets:

the three basic eligibility criteria as described in 6.1.5; or
the exceptional circumstances as described in 6.1.8; or
the two qualifying criteria pertaining to parliamentary proceedings, commissions of inquiry, inquests or other similar proceedings as described in 6.1.9; and
the requirements set out in Appendix B.

The approval authority may seek the advice of any officials who may have knowledge of the facts, as well as the legal advice of the Department of Justice Canada prior to making this decision. The decision should be made before legal counsel engages with the Crown servant to avoid a potential conflict situation, which would be detrimental to the interests of both the Crown servant and the Crown.

6.1.4 Initial presumption: In assessing the requests of Crown servants, presuming initially that they have met the basic eligibility criteria as described in 6.1.5 unless or until there is information to the contrary.

6.1.5 Three basic eligibility criteria: In considering Crown servants for legal assistance or indemnification, determining whether the Crown servant:

acted in good faith;
did not act against the interests of the Crown; and
acted within the scope of their duties or course of employment with respect to the acts or omissions giving rise to the request.

6.1.6 Legal assistance: Deciding whether to approve legal assistance requests of Crown servants who meet the three basic eligibility criteria in the following situations:

when they are sued or threatened with a suit;
when they are charged or likely to be charged with an offence;
when they are named in a legal action or under threat of being named in a legal action; or
when they are faced with serious personal liability before any court, tribunal or other judicial body.

6.1.7 Indemnification: Providing indemnification when the Crown servant meets the three basic eligibility criteria as described in 6.1.5.

6.1.7.1 Pre-approval of monetary settlement: Deciding whether to pre-approve a monetary settlement of a claim or an action made or brought against a Crown servant based on the Department of Justice Canada's recommendation.

6.1.7.2 No claim for recovery: Where the Crown is liable as a result of incidents involving Crown servants, no claims to recover such liability are to be made by the Crown against the Crown servants provided that the applicable criteria were met.

6.1.8 Exceptional circumstances: Deciding whether to provide legal assistance or indemnification in the situations enumerated in 6.1.6 where the Crown servant does not meet one or more of the three basic eligibility criteria as set out in 6.1.5, provided the approval authority considers that it would be in the public interest to approve the request, after having consulted the Advisory Committee on Legal Assistance and Indemnification.

6.1.9 Parliamentary proceedings, commissions of inquiry, inquests or other similar proceedings: Deciding whether to approve requests for legal assistance where a Crown servant is requested or compelled to appear in connection with a parliamentary proceeding, a commission of inquiry, an inquest or other similar proceedings, provided two qualifying criteria are met:

that it is in the public interest to have the Crown servant appear; and
that the matter concerns events where the Crown servant was acting within the scope of his or her duties, or in the course of employment.

6.1.10 Retroactive approval: In circumstances where it was practically unreasonable for the Crown servant to obtain approval from the approval authority in advance, and where the need for legal services was immediately necessary to protect the Crown servant's interest, deciding whether to approve legal assistance retroactively, provided that the Crown servant has made the request as soon as possible thereafter.

6.1.11 Ineligible requests: Ensuring legal assistance or indemnification requests are not approved for the following matters:

matters arising while the requestor was engaged under a contract for services, with the exception of ministers' exempt staff;
an action or claim initiated by a Crown servant unless it forms part of a legitimate defence to a legal claim, action or charge for which legal assistance was approved under this policy;
an internal investigation or an internal administrative recourse mechanism including grievances, staffing or disciplinary proceedings; and
activities undertaken/carried out by a volunteer.

6.1.12 Termination and recovery of legal assistance: Ensuring legal assistance is terminated, if at any time during or after the proceedings it becomes clear that the Crown servant did not meet the basic eligibility criteria outlined in section 6.1.5 or did not continue to qualify under the exceptional circumstances described in section 6.1.8.

Where legal assistance was approved for a Crown servant who met the criteria under 6.1.5, but it was subsequently established that they acted dishonestly or it was determined that the Crown servant did not act within the scope of their duties or course of employment, ensure that recovery action is considered and initiated for an amount equal to the legal assistance provided or the indemnification paid, and this amount shall constitute a debt owing to the Crown.

6.1.13 Reconsideration: Ensuring prior decisions refusing a request for legal assistance or indemnification because the three basic eligibility criteria were not met are reconsidered where a court or tribunal has finally concluded its proceedings and new evidence or information has demonstrated that the basic eligibility criteria were met.

In such event, the approval authority seeks the advice of the Advisory Committee on Legal Assistance and Indemnification before confirming or changing the decisions.

6.1.14 Responsibility for payment: Ensuring that:

any amounts paid pursuant to this policy are paid from the budget of the organization in which the person worked at the time the act or omission giving rise to the request first occurred. If the approval authority is from a different organization, then ensuring that the amount is referred over to such organization for payment. If that organization no longer exists, the successor to that organization is to handle the request and bear the financial costs. If no successor organization exists, then an application to the Clerk of the Privy Council may be made to determine from which budget the amounts are to be paid;
for cases involving offences, payment by the Crown does not include any fines or costs of prosecution; and
payment is not made until the request and supporting information is provided, and the approval authority has issued an authorization in writing approving the request.

6.1.15 Education and preventing liability: Ensuring Crown servants are aware that they:

are to inform the appropriate official at the earliest opportunity whenever an incident takes place that may result in a claim against the Crown or Crown servant that may give rise to the need for legal assistance; and
follow the request-making process as set out in Appendix B of this policy.

6.1.16 Private counsel: In cases where there is a conflict of interest between the Crown and the Crown servant, or when the servant is charged with an offence, deciding whether to authorize payments for private legal assistance after consulting the Department of Justice Canada with respect to the appropriateness of engaging such private counsel. Such consultation shall include the name of the proposed private counsel as well as the private counsel's proposed fee schedule. If it is determined that this source of assistance is appropriate and private legal assistance is authorized, then the approval authority shall provide written authorization to the Crown servant including the selection of private counsel, the limits of the Crown's commitment, in terms of both total expenditures and the approved fee schedules, and of the requirement for reviewing accounts by the Department of Justice Canada.
