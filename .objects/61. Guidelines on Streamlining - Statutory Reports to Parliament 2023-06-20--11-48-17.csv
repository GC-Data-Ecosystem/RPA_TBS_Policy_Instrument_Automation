Purpose,This documentis intended to assist departmental officials as well as Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) officials in the interpretation and application of section 157 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA).
Background,"Under section 157 of the FAA, statutory reports required by Parliament, or to be submitted to Parliament, can be discontinued by Order in Council (OIC) when they contain the same or less information than is contained in Public Accounts or Estimates documents, namely the Report on Plans and Priorities and the Departmental Performance Report.

This integration or streamlining of reporting must be in accord with the purpose, policies and basic disclosure principles and standards for the various reporting instruments (i.e., Part III of the Estimates and the Public Accounts), and must respect legislated requirements.

There must be no loss of information to Parliament."
Application,These guidelines apply to all departments required to produce Part III of the Estimates and the Public Accounts.
Implementation procedures,"For the purpose of integration, the information contained in the Estimates documents or Public Accounts is compared to that contained in the statutory annual report to determine whether the latter report may be discontinued. The various reporting instruments are described in Appendix A.

This process can take a complete reporting cycle leading to the required Governor-in-Council approval. The main steps to follow in order to reach final approval are:

Departments and agencies contact their TBS program sector analyst to discuss their requests for TBS to examine the potential streamlining of statutory annual reports.
TBS formally reviews the information in the Estimates documents or Public Accounts and in the statutory report in order to ensure that there is no loss of information to Parliament.
If the TBS review is favourable, a letter of attestation must be sent from the responsible minister to the President of the Treasury Board. The letter will request a potential discontinuance of the report and indicate that there is no loss of information to Parliament. The letter must also refer to the TBS's formal review.
The President of the Treasury Board will then recommend to the Governor in Council that an OIC be made directing the discontinuance of the statutory report. Note that a Treasury Board submission is not needed in this case; a recommendation letter is sufficient.

If the statutory information is not already in the Estimates documents or the Public Accounts, organizations could consider the following process during a first cycle for potential discontinuance of the report in a subsequent cycle:

The statutory report to be eliminated or integrated should be adjusted or edited to take out information inconsistent with its defined purpose and scope.
When such information is of public relations or communications value, it could be published in alternative non-statutory publications such as an annual review, a departmental newsletter, a news release, etc.
Suitable information would be transferred to the Estimates documents or the Public Accounts and also be retained in the report to be eliminated.

The streamlining of a statutory annual report can be initiated at any time during the year.

Departments and agencies planning to integrate statutory reports with the Estimates documents or the Public Accounts are advised to consult with TBS early in the process.

The department or agency must continue to produce the annual report until the Governor in Council has approved discontinuance of the statutory report by OIC."
Consolidated reports,"Some departments and agencies have consolidated statutory reports in their Estimates documents or Public Accounts (see Appendix B). They must ensure that their Estimates documents or the Public Accounts continue to contain the statutory information previously contained in the annual statutory report, when the legislation requiring this annual report is still in effect."
