Introduction,1. The purpose of this document is to define the plan; to provide managers and employees with the information needed to be able to apply the plan and understand its operation; to provide a common basis for dialogue between individual managers about individuals and circumstances and between management and employee representatives about collective interests in the plan; and to promote uniform application of the plan throughout the DS Group.
Application,"2. This plan applies to those employed as members of the Defence Scientific Service Group in Grades DS-01 to DS-07 (employees in Grades DS-07a, DS-07b and DS-08 are excluded from this pay plan)."
Authority,"3. This plan was approved under TB Decision Number 769818 dated March 14, 1980, and was subsequently amended effective March 1st, 1999 under TB Decision Number 826950 dated February 11, 1999."
Classification,"4. The DS Classification and Selection Standard specifies that this is a person-oriented level description plan. The candidate is appointed by staffing action at a designated classification level in relation to the characteristics of the work to be performed and individual qualifications of the candidate.

5. The characteristics of each bargained level are summarized in the level determinants of the DS Classification and Selection Standard and are attached for reference in Appendix A. An examination of these determinants will show that they are descriptions written from a career perspective and not just from the short-term perspective of the current assignment and performance. The degree of complexity and responsibility of a defence scientist's assignments tends to increase as the employee matures (i.e. as knowledge and abilities develop with experience). The general characteristics associated with an individual scientist are compared with the level determinants in order to establish his or her classification level and state of professional development within the level. An employee's classification level is governed solely by the Classification and Selection Standard and the DS Promotion and Salary Advancement Guidelines produced pursuant to the Classification and Selection Standard, and is not a product of the Salary Progression Guidelines outlined in paragraphs 11 to 16 below."
Implementation,"Merit review

6. The purpose of the DS Merit Review is to assess the state of professional development of individual scientists and to determine promotions and appropriate salary progression.

7. Actions resulting from a Merit Review shall be implemented effective April 1 of each year.

8. The Merit Review forms the basis for decisions to promote, withhold a pay increment, grant a single increment, grant multiple increments and grant increments over a single or double barrier on the effective date.

9. The Merit Review is a three-stage process. The first stage is the provision of information about the employee, with input from the employee, the immediate supervisor and the accountable manager, including assessment and salary recommendations from the accountable manager. The second stage involves a review of the Performance Evaluation and salary recommendation for each DS by a Reviewing Officer. The following types of cases shall be referred to the Defence Scientist Human Resource Management Committee (DSHRMC):

recommendations that an employee or the reviewing officer do not agree to;
recommendations for the withholding of an increment or the awarding of more than 2 increments;
recommendations for promotion to DS-03, DS-04, DS-05, DS-06 and DS-07;
unsatisfactory assessment recommendations;
cases that, in the view of the Chairperson of the DSHRMC, should be reviewed by the Committee. Employees will be informed if such action has been taken.

Review by the DSHRMC is the third stage in the process. The DSHRMC normally consists of senior defence research management and members of the external scientific community. The main responsibility of the DSHRMC is to review the matters referred to it and to make the subsequent final decision on the resulting appointment levels and salary actions. It is also responsible for ensuring that classification actions are administered in conformity with the DS Classification Standard and that assessments, the pay plan and the standard are applied uniformly and equitably throughout the population of employees to which they apply. When the DSHRMC changes a recommendation, an employee shall be provided with a written explanation of such changes.

DS assessment

10. The factors that will be used in the DS assessment process are itemized in Appendix B.

DS Salary progression guidelines

11. The following guidelines are intended to permit progressive action towards providing employees with salaries consistent with their state of professional development.

12. The normal rates of salary progression within the levels will be as follows:

annual increments - DS-02, DS-03, DS-06 and DS-07
annual increments - below the double barriers in DS-04 and DS-05
 
biennial increments - crossing the double barriers in DS-04 and DS-05 and at each single barrier thereafter

13. Employees in DS-03, and those below the double barriers in DS-04 and DS-05, may receive double increments if they are developing at a much faster rate than normal towards meeting the criteria for promotion to the next level.

14. Slower than normal rates of salary progression may also occur.

15. Employees will be considered for promotion after one year at the DS-01 level and after one year at the maximum of DS-02 and DS-03 levels, the double barrier in DS-04 and the sixth increment in DS-05. Consideration for promotion can occur at other points on the salary scale.

16. There may be, on occasion, an assessment recommendation of ""Unsatisfactory"". An unsatisfactory rating would occur where the evidence shows the employee's actual state of professional development to be unacceptably low by comparison with the normal state of professional development for the employee's grade and salary. An employee whose performance is assessed as ""Unsatisfactory"" will be denied advancement to the next step on the scale, and will be notified, in writing, of the decision to that effect not more than six (6) weeks and not less than two (2) weeks prior to the increment date."
General,"Rate of pay on initial appointment

17. Entrants to the DS Group with a bachelor's degree or a bachelor's degree with limited experience will normally be appointed at the DS-01 level. This level will also be used for term appointments of university graduate students who demonstrate an interest in continuing employment within the group on completion of their graduate studies.

18. Entrants to the DS Group with a master's degree or a master's degree with limited experience will normally be appointed in the DS-02 range.

19. Entrants to the DS Group with a PhD degree or a PhD degree with limited experience will normally be appointed in the DS-03 range.

20. For experienced personnel, the rate of pay on initial appointment shall be a rate consistent with the appointment level and assessed state of professional development.

Rate of pay on promotion

21. The guidelines describe the normal points at which employees may be recommended for promotion, but they are not intended to prohibit promotion from any point in the pay range.

22. On promotion, an employee shall be paid a rate of pay that provides for an increase in salary that is at least equal to the lowest pay increment for the level to which the employee is promoted.

23. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an employee who is promoted on a day on which he or she is also eligible for consideration for an incremental increase, shall not normally receive that salary increment in addition to the salary adjustment provided by paragraph 22.

Significance of barriers

24. All of the single barriers in DS-03 and below the double barriers in DS-04 and DS-05 are points at which the salary of an employee, whose state of professional development is significantly lower than normally expected, may be held for an additional year beyond that which is normal. In addition, the double barriers in the DS-04 and DS-05 ranges, all of the single barriers above the double barriers in the DS-04 and DS-05 ranges, and all the single barriers in the DS-06 and DS-07 pay ranges are points at which employees' salary progression may terminate because they have ceased to demonstrate an increase in their state of professional development.

Pay increment dates

25. The date on which employees shall be considered eligible for pay increment consideration will be April 1.

26. The first review date for an employee shall be April 1 following the date of initial appointment to the DS Group, provided that the employee has earned at least twenty-six (26) weeks of pay immediately prior to the April 1 review date. An employee who has not completed this minimum requirement will not be entitled to the first merit review until the next annual review date of April 1."
