3. Context,"3.1 Geospatial data is defined as data with implicit or explicit reference to a location relative to the Earth. This standard establishes the information infrastructure to support the discovery and use of geospatial information and to enable information sharing among departments, with other jurisdictions, and with the private sector.

3.2 Geospatial data important to social, economic and cultural well-being is produced or used by federal departments, the provinces, territories, and others. This includes mapping products to support activities such as search and rescue, geospatial intelligence, and fire fighting. Standardization is essential in this context. It allows data from one source to be easily used with those from another source to create a richer and more useful product. The Standard on Geospatial Data adopts measures that have been endorsed by federal departments, provincial and territorial governments, as well as by academic and private sector participants in the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure. 

3.3 This standard will allow departments to share data and maximize utility of existing mapping and related products. Departments will also be able to exploit commercially available tools and software in common use around to world to discover, access and use geospatial data. This will result in significant efficiencies in the sharing and use of public sector mapping products. More broadly, it will support departments' mandated programs and services, allowing them to address and respond to economic, environmental and societal challenges more effectively.

3.4 This standard is issued under the authority of section 7 of the Financial Administration Act by the Secretary of the Treasury Board pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Policy on Information Management and section 3.5 of the Policy on the Management of Information Technology.

3.5 This standard is to be read in conjunction with the Policy on Information Management, and the Policy on the Management of Information Technology."
