Policy objective,To provide terms and conditions of employment for locally-engaged staff employed outside Canada.
Policy statement,"At Canadian posts abroad, where it is practical and in the public interest, local persons are engaged to perform office and household operating and maintenance functions. The Locally-Engaged Staffs' Terms and Conditions Regulations are designed to establish a personnel management system which will take into account local law and practice, operational requirements of Posts and comparability with local employers. In this way local employees will be provided with reasonable terms and conditions of employment, while posts will be able to recruit, retain and motivate qualified staff."
Application,"The Locally-Engaged Staffs' Terms and Conditions Regulations apply to any person who is filling a locally-engaged position, or is appointed on an emergency basis under these regulations."
Policy requirements,"With the exception of Canadian Forces Europe, External Affairs and International Trade Canada is responsible for the provision of administrative support services at posts outside Canada.

The Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs is authorized to classify positions and set terms and conditions of employment, including pay and benefits (but excluding pensions and insurance), for employees engaged locally at posts abroad, including both integrated and non-integrated employees. The Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs is also responsible for the printing and distribution of the Locally-Engaged Staffs' Terms and Conditions Regulations and for making them available upon request, for those who require them.

The Deputy Minister of National Defence is authorized to classify positions and set local terms and conditions of employment, including pay and benefits (but excluding pensions and insurance), for civilian component employees hired locally by Canadian Forces Europe.

The responsibility for pensions and insurance has not been delegated but remains under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Board Secretariat."
