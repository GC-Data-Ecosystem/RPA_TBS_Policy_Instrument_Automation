Policy objective,To provide special terms and conditions of employment for personnel serving outside Canada.
Policy statement,"Living conditions and conditions of employment outside Canada are affected by a variety of circumstances over which the employer and the employee have only limited control. In recognition of these differences, special terms and conditions of employment are provided for career foreign service employees, foreign assignment employees, Heads of Mission, members of the Canadian Forces serving outside Canada, members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police serving outside Canada, civilian foreign assignment employees serving abroad with the Canadian Forces and staff engaged locally outside Canada."
Application,"This policy applies to members of the Canadian Forces serving outside Canada, members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police serving outside Canada, staff engaged locally outside Canada and all employees serving outside Canada who are within that portion of the Public Service of Canada

Policy requirements,"The Foreign Service Directives apply to career foreign service employees, foreign assignment employees, Heads of Mission, military attachés and their staff and members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police serving outside Canada.
 
The Foreign Service Directives are revised periodically following consultation in the National Joint Council of the Public Service of Canada and are issued as a separate volume within the Treasury Board Manual.
 
Civilian foreign assignment employees serving abroad with the Canadian Forces in a military environment come under the same provisions as those that apply to their military counterparts except for relocation and leave provisions, which are in accordance with the Foreign Service Directives. For all other purposes, these employees come under the Military Foreign Service Regulations. These regulations are administered by the Department of National Defence and enquiries should be directed to that department.
Persons serving at posts abroad in the role of Head of Mission come under the Heads of Post Directives. Responsibility for the administration of these directives rests with External Affairs and International Trade Canada. Any relevant enquiries should be directed to that department.

Persons engaged locally outside Canada come under the provisions of the Locally Engaged Staffs' Terms and Conditions Regulations (see chapter 2-2). Copies of these regulations are available from External Affairs and International Trade Canada. Any relevant enquiries should be directed to that department."
Monitoring,The Foreign Service Directives require reports to the Treasury Board Secretariat or to the appropriate foreign service interdepartmental coordinating committee. Directive 70 of the Foreign Service Directives outlines the frequency and details of the various reporting requirements.
