1. Introduction,"This guide:

reflects best practices in real property portfolio management
supports the development, implementation and monitoring of a real property portfolio strategy, as set out in subsections 4.1.4 and 4.2.5 of the Treasury Board Directive on the Management of Real Property

Custodians:
Footnote
1

are responsible for the administration of federal real property
Footnote
2
may adjust their approach to portfolio management to align with their structure and operational context

The full technical guide to portfolio management and real property portfolio strategies can be obtained by contacting the Investment Management Directorate at TBS-SCTInvestmentManagement-Gestiondesinvestissements@tbs-sct.gc.ca.

Custodians are required to:

develop, implement and monitor a real property portfolio strategy
use this strategy when making investment decisions
Footnote
3

A real property portfolio strategy is a strategic planning document that:

has a planning horizon of at least 10 years
looks beyond singular assets
sets the direction for how the real property portfolio
Footnote
4 will be intentionally and proactively managed to support:
the custodian’s mandate, strategic business objectives and forward-looking program requirements
the Government of Canada’s priorities for real property and socio-economic and environmental outcomes (for example, greening government operations)
sound stewardship and best value to the Crown

Using evidence-based analysis, a real property portfolio strategy:

assesses the current state of the portfolio
describes the desired future state of the portfolio
identifies financial and non-financial risks and resource gaps associated with achieving the desired future state
charts a strategic road map for the portfolio as it evolves and responds to program needs, the Government of Canada’s broader objectives and the context of corporate real estate"
"2. Roles, responsibilities and governance","Deputy heads are responsible for compliance with Treasury Board policies, including designating a senior official
Footnote
5 or senior officials responsible for the management of real property and the development, implementation, and monitoring of a real property portfolio strategy.
Footnote
6

Federal real property is a strategic platform that supports custodians in delivering mandated programs and services to Canadians. To meet the requirements set out in subsections 4.1.1.4 and 4.1.1.5 of the Directive on the Management of Real Property, and as a best practice, there should be a consultation on a real property portfolio strategy. In addition to the consultation, the strategy should be communicated internally by the custodian and endorsed by an appropriate governance body (for example, a senior advisory board) at the assistant deputy minister level. This governance body should include the senior designated official or officials for the management of real property and key stakeholders, including the chief financial officer and senior officials responsible for the delivery of programs and services.
Footnote
7 The development of the portfolio strategy should integrate and reflect the feedback and decisions made by the appropriate governance body or senior advisory board."
3. Portfolio management principles,"Portfolio management:

is the ongoing process of aligning the real property portfolio with strategic priorities and forward‑looking program requirements while considering risks and resource constraints
overcomes geographic and functional silos through central oversight of the performance of the portfolio and its related investments

The foundation of a real property portfolio strategy rests on five principles of portfolio management. The way in which these principles are applied may be tailored to suit a custodian’s specific operational context.

3.1 Enable strategic objectives and contribute to government priorities

Real property supports the delivery of programs and services to Canadians and enables the advancement of broader strategic objectives (for example, achieving net-zero carbon operations and contributing to climate resilience, furthering Indigenous reconciliation, driving digital transformation, improving accessibility, conserving heritage value and stimulating the economy).

3.2 Use information management

Comprehensive, reliable and current information on real property assets and the use of an information management system to facilitate data analysis are the backbone of evidence-based portfolio management.

3.3 Analyze segments, not just individual assets

Similar assets are considered together to allow for a higher-level perspective of the portfolio, typically organized by function, asset type, priority and location. This higher-level perspective promotes the discovery of opportunities within and between segments, such as consolidation, resource-sharing, talent mobility, collaboration across government and economies of scale.

3.4 Use life-cycle costing techniques

Real property decisions must be based on an assessment of full life-cycle costs. Life-cycle costing is a logical, systematic process for estimating the total cost of real property through its whole life from the initial planning to acquisition, use and disposal.
Footnote
8

3.5 Highlight areas of risk

Risk management involves identifying, balancing, and mitigating internal and external risk factors (environmental, legal, operational, reputational and financial) to effectively realize the outcomes that are expected from the real property portfolio.
Footnote
9"
4. Portfolio management process,"The portfolio management process consists of seven broadly defined steps, which can be undertaken concurrently, and which are illustrated in Figure 1.
Footnote
10 The appropriate governance body or senior advisory board should be engaged during each of the seven steps as their role is to allow for input, internal challenge, decision-making and endorsement from the custodian’s internal functions.

4.1 Understand the current state of the portfolio (the supply)

Determine how the portfolio is performing using performance indicators and benchmarks. Monitor the functionality, utilization, and physical, environmental and financial performance of real property assets over their life-cycle.

4.2 Facilitate the development of a portfolio vision

Describe the desired state of the portfolio and include strategic objectives and priorities, such as achieving net-zero operations. Senior officials responsible for the delivery of programs and services should be involved in the development of the portfolio vision by participating in strategic planning discussions with the appropriate governance body or senior advisory board. The vision guides decision‑making for the rest of the portfolio management process.

4.3 Understand the requirements of the real property portfolio (the demand)

Enable informed and integrated real property management decisions through collaboration between real property officials and program leads. Analyze and forecast demand over time by looking for new ways to support the portfolio vision, including solutions that may not involve real property.

4.4 Compare and analyze supply and demand

Assess the current supply against demand, which includes the portfolio vision, to inform resourcing and sequencing decisions, as well as the investment plan. Consider the results from an environmental scan (for example, market conditions, inflation rates, availability of labour and services, and supply chains).

4.5 Explore options to close the gap between supply and demand

Conduct a gap analysis and explore the most effective ways of optimizing the portfolio while minimizing the gap between supply and demand. Evaluate trade-offs to minimize the gap while respecting resource constraints and risk tolerances. Fully account for the financial and non-financial resources that are committed to the portfolio, including the human resources, contracted real property services and sources of funds (including any spending constraints).

4.6 Prepare the real property portfolio strategy and the portfolio implementation plan

The real property portfolio strategy helps decision-makers and stakeholders understand what the portfolio will achieve in the longer term and how strategic objectives will be met. It covers a planning horizon of at least 10 years and includes a shorter-term, 5-year portfolio implementation plan.

The portfolio strategy includes:

an overview of the real property portfolio and its performance
a summary of demand, including the portfolio vision
a description of the gap between supply and demand and the plan to close the gap
a summary of planned, low-risk investments and significant investments
Footnote
11
a summary of how socio-economic priorities are addressed (for example, accessibility and heritage conservation), including how the commitments in the Greening Government Strategy will be met
Footnote
12
the financial and non-financial resources needed to support and maintain the portfolio
a risk assessment
key performance indicators and targets
a five-year implementation plan

The five-year implementation plan details planned investments. It includes a delivery schedule, specific financial and non‑financial resource allocations, and key interdependencies. The implementation plan is used in the investment planning process.

For more information on the contents of the real property portfolio strategy, see “Contents of the real property portfolio strategy.”

4.7 Implement and monitor the approved plan

Implementation refers to the delivery of the implementation plan. Monitoring ensures that progress is regularly assessed and reported against a baseline. Monitoring keeps implementation on track and makes visible whether the real property portfolio is delivering on expected results.
