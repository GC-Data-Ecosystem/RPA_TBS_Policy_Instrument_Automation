1. Date of publication,"This guide was published on November 22, 2019."
"2. Application, purpose and scope","This guide applies to the organizations listed in section 6 of the Policy on Financial Management.

This guide provides information on:

internal charging between departments
special financial authorities that allow for revenues and receipts to be spent from the Consolidated Revenue Fund

This guide supports the Directive on Charging and Special Financial Authorities (the directive) by:

providing specific information on how to meet the directive's requirements
recommending best practices for implementing the directive

This guide complements the directive; it does not present new mandatory requirements. Examples and tips are provided for illustrative purposes only and may not apply to all departments or situations.

While this guide does not apply to the establishment of fees as defined under the provisions of the Service Fees Act, section 5 of this guide applies to revenue generated by fees."
3. Overview,"Internal charging involves the costing, charging, and recovery of expenditures incurred in the provision of goods or services between departments in the Government of Canada.

Generally, all revenues and receipts must be credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The only exceptions are where departments have special financial authorities, including:

the department has revenue spending authority (either a revolving fund or vote netted revenues), as shown in Figure 1
the receipt is special purpose money that is subject to section 21 of the Financial Administration Act
the receipt can be credited back to the vote under section 39 of the Financial Administration Act
the receipt is from another department and will be used to deliver a program on behalf of that department (that is, a credit to another government department's suspense account)

Note: Revolving fund authority and vote netted revenue authority can be granted by an appropriation act pursuant to section 29.1 of the Financial Administration Act. In practice, this is the most common way vote netted revenues are obtained. Revolving fund authority and vote netted revenue authority can also be granted by a department’s enabling statute or, in the case of a revolving fund authority, by the Revolving Funds Act."
4. Types of internal charging,"This section provides guidance on the 2 types of internal charging in the Government of Canada and the general requirements for their administration:

internal charging for enterprise services (subsection 4.1)
internal charging when collaborating (subsection 4.2)
administrative requirements for internal charging (subsection 4.3)
4.1 Internal charging for enterprise services

Subsections 4.4 and 4.5 of the directive list the requirements for internal charging for enterprise services.

4.1.1
Enterprise services

Enterprise services (which include common services) are services offered by departments that have the mandate to provide services to other government departments. Enterprise services may be mandatory or optional. See the Common Services Policy for more information.

4.1.2
Enterprise service organization

An enterprise service organization (which includes common service providers) is a department or organization designated as a central supplier of specific services to departments.

4.1.3
Authority to charge

Only enterprise service organizations may provide enterprise services to client departments and charge for them. The authority to charge for enterprise services must also be consistent with the department’s mandate and priorities (see subsection 4.5.1 of the directive). The authority to charge does not automatically authorize the spending of the resulting revenues. Departments must have specific authority from Parliament to spend the revenues collected.

See section 5 of this guide for information on special financial authorities that can be obtained to respend funds.

4.1.4
Interdepartmental charges for enterprise services

In accordance with subsections 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 of the directive, departments must:

estimate the cost of providing the enterprise service
ensure that the amount to be charged does not exceed the approved estimate (that is, the estimated cost of providing the enterprise service)
ensure that fees charged are reasonable (that is, while the estimated costs are the maximum that can be charged, a lower amount can sometimes be considered based on other factors)
present the costing methodology used and the determination of rates when Treasury Board approval is required



More information is available in the Guidelines on Costing.

4.2 Internal charging when collaborating

Subsections 4.6 and 4.7 of the directive list the requirements for internal charging when collaborating with another department. These requirements apply to any department that provides internal support services as defined in section 29.2 of the Financial Administration Act.

4.2.1
Internal charging for internal support services under section 29.2 of the Financial Administration Act

Section 29.2 of the Financial Administration Act authorizes the provision and receipt of internal support services between departments. Internal support services are administrative services that:

support a department or a program
do not include those delivered directly to the public



Subsection 29.2(4) of the Financial Administration Act defines the following as internal support services:

human resources management services
financial management services
information management services
information technology services
communications services
real property services
materiel services
acquisition services
any other administrative service that is designated by order of the Governor in Council



Certain services may not be provided under the authority of section 29.2 of the Financial Administration Act. Under subsection 29.2(3) of the Financial Administration Act, a department is not authorized to provide services ""if, under the authority of an act of Parliament, an order-in-council, or the direction of Treasury Board:

those services may be provided only by another department or body, including situations where a department or body has been recognized as the sole federal provider of a service. Other departments must obtain the service from the recognized provider or from a source outside the federal government.
departments are required to obtain mandatory services from enterprise service organizations, in accordance with a Treasury Board policy instrument or decision. Departments that are not enterprise service organizations may not provide these services.
the department is precluded from providing internal support services.""
4.2.2
Interdepartmental charges for internal support services

In accordance with subsection 4.6.1 of the directive, interdepartmental charges are made to recover incremental costs incurred in providing internal support services to other departments.

In accordance with subsection 4.6.1.1 of the directive, charges may be waived in an agreement if the costs of providing services to a department are minimal.

4.2.3
Authority to spend revenues

Section 29.2 of the Financial Administration Act does not provide the authority to spend revenues. Departments require legal authority to spend the revenues collected from providing internal support services in order to offset expenditures incurred when providing such services (referred to as revenue spending authority).

Where a department has, or anticipates having, revenues from internal support services, and intends to spend all or part of the revenues but does not have statutory authority
Footnote
1 to do so, the department must obtain annual parliamentary authority to be able to spend all or part of the revenues, in accordance with:

paragraph 29.1(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act
the vote netted revenue requirements defined in the directive



A few departments have statutory authority granted by their enabling act to spend revenues received through the conduct of their operations.

Similarly, subsection 29.1(1) of the Financial Administration Act provides statutory authority for a departmental corporation
Footnote
2 to respend revenues received through the conduct of its operations.

Departments seeking to establish a revenue-spending authority for the provision of internal support services may contact their departmental program sector analyst at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for guidance.

4.2.4
Authority related to personal information

The authority to provide internal support services to, and receive such services from, other departments implicitly gives authority to provide and receive the necessary personal information. Departments should respect the requirements of the Privacy Act and associated privacy policies and directives whenever they share personal information.

4.3 Administrative requirements for internal charging
4.3.1
Requirement for a written agreement

A written agreement between departments is required before goods or services are provided. A written agreement should normally include the following:

a description of the services to be provided
clearly defined roles and responsibilities
mechanisms for making decisions and resolving disputes
the period of the agreement and the notice required for withdrawal or termination
the service levels and performance expectations that have been agreed upon
the basis for charging for the services provided, the arrangements for invoicing and account settlement, and the information that will be provided to support the charges
the types of personal information to be collected and disclosed under the agreement and the purposes for which such information will be used (this information is only required when personal information is collected)
4.3.2
Transparent billing

In accordance with subsections 4.5.4 and 4.7.4 of the directive, invoices to client departments must have sufficient detail to support section 34 certification under the Financial Administration Act.

The information in the invoice must support the delegated authority in verifying and documenting that the work has been performed, the goods have been supplied, or the services have been rendered in accordance with the terms of the agreement (see subsection A.2.2.1.7 of Appendix A to the Directive on Delegation of Spending and Financial Authorities). This information may include:

a detailed description of the services provided (for example, the specific services provided and items charged along with the dates or periods of time when the services were provided)
the total amount owing
a detailed breakdown of the costs of the services (including volume and unit cost where appropriate) and the items charged during the period
any other relevant information that would help the delegated authority responsible for exercising certification authority verify the information in the invoice (Financial Administration Act, section 34)"
5. Special financial authorities,"This section provides guidance on the following special financial authorities that allow departments to spend revenues and receipts:

revolving funds (subsection 5.2)
vote netted revenues (subsection 5.3)
special purpose money (subsection 5.4)
receipts that are respendable (subsection 5.5)
other government department (OGD) suspense accounts (subsection 5.6)
5.1 Authority to spend revenues

The authority to charge does not automatically authorize the spending of the resulting revenues. Under subsection 4.1.2 of the directive, all revenues must be deposited into the Consolidated Revenue Fund unless a department has specific authority from Parliament to spend the revenues collected. A few departments have statutory authority granted by their enabling act to spend revenues generated through the conduct of their operations.

Under subsection 4.10.3 of the directive, departments seeking a revenue spending authority must ensure that the expenses incurred to provide goods and services are directly related to the revenue generated through the sale of these goods and services. Generally, the authority sought to spend revenues previously deposited in the Consolidated Revenue Fund will reduce the appropriations of the department by the same amount, ensuring that there is no net increase in the draw on the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

To determine which revenue spending authority is most appropriate, departments should refer to Table 1 and contact their departmental program sector analyst at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for guidance.

Table 1: points of comparison between a revolving fund and vote netted revenue
Point of comparison	Revolving fund	Vote netted revenue


Authority to charge fees

	

Authority may be obtained through one of the following:

departmental or program legislation
sections 19 and 19.1 of the Financial Administration Act
ministerial authority to contract
	

Authority may be obtained through one of the following:

departmental or program legislation
sections 19 and 19.1 of the Financial Administration Act
ministerial authority to contract
section 29.2 of the Financial Administration Act



Authority to spend revenues

	

Authority may be established under one of the following:

departmental or program legislation
the Revolving Funds Act
an appropriation act as authorized by paragraph 29.1(2)(b) of the Financial Administration Act

Departments can generally retain all revenues, but they may be directed to deposit accumulated surpluses (Treasury Board approval required) in the Consolidated Revenue Fund to reduce an excessive authority limit accumulated over past years or if there is no anticipated future use.

	

Authority may be established under one of the following:

departmental or program legislation
subsection 29.1(1) of the Financial Administration Act for departmental corporations
an appropriation act as authorized by paragraph 29.1(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act

Departments can generally spend up to 125% of estimated revenues. Departments must request Treasury Board approval to spend any revenues collected above this threshold.




Type of authority

	

It is a continuing, non-lapsing authority that allows for payments out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, in excess of revenues collected, up to a stipulated limit (that is, the drawdown authority).

	

It is a lapsing authority that allows revenues to offset related expenditures in the same fiscal year. It must be renewed every year in an appropriation act unless the department has statutory authority.




Scale of operations

	

Operations must be:

sufficiently large to warrant the cost of setting up a revolving fund
distinct from activities funded by appropriations
	

The scale of operations is less important than for a revolving fund. Operations must be distinct from activities funded by appropriations.




Type of demand for goods and services and level of activity

	

The demand for services is extremely variable.

The objective is to fund fluctuating demands from user groups for goods and services.

The level of activity is not fixed. Operations are expected to be self-sufficient and break even over their business cycle.

	

There is small to medium fluctuation in the demand for services.




Self-sufficiency

	

Operations are completely, or almost completely, self-sufficient.

	

Operations are expected to remain within the vote netted revenue authority and be partly self-sufficient.




Multi-year focus for matching revenue with related expenditures

	

Revenues are generally applied against expenditures over the revolving fund’s business cycle.

Because demand for services is extremely variable, expenditures do not necessarily occur in the same fiscal year as revenues.

Flexibility is needed to:

deal with changes in the level and timing of revenues, expenditures and net income
recover the cost of capital assets that have a high-dollar value
	

Revenues are generally applied against related expenditures incurred in the same fiscal year unless otherwise authorized by legislation.




Reporting requirements

	

Accrual accounting, including capitalization of assets, is required. Accrual accounting must reconcile with modified cash accounting for reporting purposes.

A cost-accounting system is required.

Under subsection 4.8.2 of the directive, financial statements must be prepared annually for each revolving fund.

Under subsection 4.8.3 of the directive, an annual assessment of the operational and financial performance of the revolving fund must be conducted.

	

Modified cash accounting and a cost-accounting system are required.




Example

	

Department A manages a revolving fund and it can respend revenues collected from services provided to Canadians.

Revenues do not lapse and remain available to finance ongoing operations, including potential capital acquisitions and temporary deficit situations.

	

Department B has vote netted revenue authority to respend revenues generated from the provision of specific internal support services to Department C (for example, human resources management and financial management services).

The revenues can only be spent to offset the costs of providing the services that were incurred in that same year.

Revenues lapse after the close of the fiscal year in which they were collected.

5.2 Revolving funds

Subsections 4.8 and 4.9 of the directive list the requirements for revolving funds. These requirements apply to any department that has established a revolving fund that has a statutory drawdown limit through an appropriation act, the Revolving Funds Act, or departmental or program legislation.

Revolving funds are funding mechanisms where revenues remain available to finance continuing operations without fiscal year limitations. In the Government of Canada, revolving funds are used to provide funding for specific purposes where there is continuous authorization by Parliament to make payments out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The use of revolving funds is appropriate for substantial, distinct activities that provide client-oriented services where costs can be financed from revenues over a reasonable business cycle.

The statutory drawdown authority essentially provides a line of credit for the revolving fund where aggregate expenditures are less than or equal to the sum of aggregate revenues received and the drawdown authority set in legislation. Interest is charged on the amount of drawdown used, and a repayment schedule should be included in the fund’s business plan.

Activities financed by the fund are maintained separately from the activities financed by appropriations, and costs unrelated to the business of the revolving fund should not be charged to it. The types of costs that can be charged to the fund are often set out in the legislation establishing the fund.

5.2.1
Establishing a revolving fund

Revolving funds are established by legislation. The legislation may be specific to a department or it may be an amendment to the Revolving Funds Act. In addition, paragraph 29.1(2)(b) of the Financial Administration Act provides authority for a revolving fund to be established or amended through an appropriation act.

There are many conditions that a department should meet before requesting Treasury Board approval to establish a revolving fund (see subsection A.1 of Appendix A to this guide). The following documentation should be submitted for approval by the department:

a charter document (the operating charter)
a business plan covering the objectives of the financial and business lines over a period of 3 to 5 years
a Treasury Board submission seeking approval of:
authorities for operating the revolving fund
the terms and conditions for managing it
appropriate financial statements, including an opening pro forma balance sheet



See subsection A.2 of Appendix A to this guide for more information on the content of the Treasury Board submission.

Under subsection 4.9.1 of the directive, ""legislative approval for any matter"" involves:

the establishment and operation of a revolving fund
changes to the amount of the statutory drawdown for a revolving fund
changes to the purposes or the scope of operations of a revolving fund
changes to the net authority used (which requires a source of funds) related to accumulated surpluses or deficits
the wind-down of operations of a revolving fund (see subsection A.4 of Appendix A to this guide)



Legislation that establishes a revolving fund does 3 things:

It gives the minister a non-lapsing statutory authority to make expenditures out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for a purpose specified in the legislation.
It gives the minister a non-lapsing statutory authority to spend any revenues related to that purpose.
It sets a limit on expenditures where the aggregate expenditures for the specified purpose never exceed the sum of aggregate revenues and the statutory drawdown authority.
5.2.2
Reporting requirements

Under subsection 4.8.3 of the directive, departments must conduct an annual assessment of the operational and financial performance of the fund. Departments may be required to submit a multi-year business plan for each revolving fund to the Treasury Board (see subsection A.3 of Appendix A to this guide).

Under subsection 4.8.1 of the directive, departments must keep separate accounts for each revolving fund. Departments should also track their use of statutory authorities to ensure that these accounts are never exceeded.

5.2.3
Financial statements and financial performance

Under subsection 4.8.2 of the directive, the financial statements of a revolving fund should be prepared in accordance with:

the ""Public Sector Accounting Standards"" and the ""Public Sector Guidelines"" issued by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (login required)
the Government of Canada Accounting Handbook



Under subsection 4.8.5 of the directive, departments must inform the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat of any significant change in their operating environment and in the fund’s financial performance (for example, in cases of accumulated deficits).

5.2.4
Planned changes to a revolving fund

Under subsection 4.9.2 of the directive, departments must obtain Treasury Board approval for planned changes to key operating aspects of a revolving fund, including:

the scale and materiality of the fund’s activities
the resources or assets transferred to or from the revolving fund, or the obligations assumed or relinquished by the fund
the elements of direct or indirect costs to be charged to the revolving fund, or the basis for allocating indirect overhead costs to the fund
the basis of fee- or rate-setting
5.2.5
Accumulated surplus or deficit

Under subsection 4.8.4 of the directive, a revolving fund must be self-sufficient over its business cycle. While surpluses or deficits may occur in a given year, these are expected to balance out over a business cycle. Revolving funds are funded through non-lapsing appropriations, providing the flexibility needed to:

deal with changes in the level and timing of revenues, expenditures and net income
manage substantial investments in inventory and capital



Surpluses beyond the revolving fund’s business cycle may indicate that clients are being overcharged, while accumulated deficits may indicate that the revolving fund is not self-sufficient or that there are other underlying issues.

The Treasury Board may direct that surpluses be deposited in the Consolidated Revenue Fund if there is no expectation of offset by future deficits or if there are no anticipated uses (for example, investment in systems). The rationale is that the Treasury Board may want to reduce an excessive authority limit that has accumulated over past years.

In cases of accumulated deficits and under subsection 4.8.5 of the directive, departments must inform the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat of any significant change in their operating environment and in the fund’s financial performance.

5.3 Vote netted revenues

Subsections 4.10 and 4.11 of the directive list the requirements for vote netted revenue (VNR). These requirements apply to any department that has established a VNR authority either under departmental or program legislation, or more commonly, through an appropriation act.

Under subsection 4.10.2 of the directive, VNR authority must be obtained annually from Parliament (for example, through an appropriation act), as it is a lapsing authority.

Under subsection 4.10.1 of the directive, departments must provide vote wording
Footnote
3 to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for inclusion in appropriation acts. Only a few departments have specific statutory authorizations to expend some or all of their revenues on an ongoing basis.

Under subsections 4.10.3 and 4.10.4 of the directive, departments must ensure that:

revenues offset related expenditures incurred in the same fiscal year that the revenues are received
any revenues not related to these expenditures are recorded as non-respendable revenue

VNR authority provides an alternative means of wholly or partially funding selected programs or activities that generate revenues. This authority can accommodate fluctuating demands from user groups without jeopardizing the core budget of a department. Normally, using a VNR authority is appropriate where:

a department performs ongoing activities that generate revenues from established sources internal or external to the government
fluctuations in the level of revenue-generating activities will lead to corresponding and proportional changes in expenditures and revenues

Under either of the aforementioned scenarios, operations should be aligned to the fluctuating volumes of service in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the program (for example, high fixed costs for full-time equivalents may increase risk if volumes fluctuate).

VNR authority is also the mandatory mechanism to be used when a department:

provides internal support services under section 29.2 of the Financial Administration Act and
seeks to respend the revenues, unless the department has statutory authority to expend revenues
5.3.1
Treasury Board approval for establishing a VNR authority

Under subsection 4.11.1 of the directive, departments must obtain Treasury Board approval before seeking VNR authority from Parliament via an appropriation act. The Treasury Board submission must identify the specific revenues, activities and programs for which VNR authority is being sought. If approved, vote wording will be included in the appropriate vote of an appropriation act.

The Treasury Board submission should normally include the following:

how the departmental mandate allows for these revenue-generating activities
the projected demand for the activity in terms of gross expenditures and revenues over the next 5 years
the rationale for using revenues as a source of financing for the activity
the estimated amount of revenue for which VNR authority is sought (the amount may be subsequently adjusted through the annual Estimates process)
the proposed vote wording to be included in subsequent appropriation acts (this wording should be comprehensive and reflect the Treasury Board approval being sought and any previous VNR approvals obtained)
whether the revenue-generating activities are partially appropriated
how the rate setting and the proposed rate structure were determined



More information is available in the Guidance for the Preparation of TB Submissions.

Departments seeking to establish a VNR authority may contact their departmental program sector analyst at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for guidance.

5.3.2
Rates for pricing purposes

Rates should be set in accordance with the Treasury Board Guide to Cost Estimating, which provide guidance on cost recovery and charging. As part of the Annual Reference Level Update, the basis for setting the rates to be charged in the next fiscal year may be reviewed by the Treasury Board. Changes in rates may require Treasury Board approval, as described in subsection 5.3.5 and shown in Figure 2.

5.3.3
Recovery of expenditures in the capital vote

Under subsection 4.10.6 of the directive, recovery of capital expenditures:

must not be recorded against the department’s operating VNR authority
cannot be respent
must be recorded as non-tax, non-respendable revenues to be credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund
5.3.4
125% rule

At the start of each fiscal year, vote netted amounts are reset and departments provide the estimated amount of revenues to be collected. The 125% rule provides added flexibility to departments by allowing them to generally respend up to 125% of the forecast revenues resulting from volume change, as long as there is a sufficient unencumbered balance.

Under subsection 4.10.5 of the directive, if revenues exceed 125% of the estimated amount in a fiscal year, an authority must be sought and approved by the Treasury Board to offset related expenditures. Departments must consult their expenditures management sector analyst at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and provide a rationale for increasing their VNR authority above 125%.

5.3.5
Changes to VNR authority

There are several reasons why a department may need to increase or decrease its VNR authority. The mechanism that departments may use to seek approval will depend on the reason for adjusting the VNR authority. The situations below apply to internal charging situations only; Treasury Board approval is required for increases in VNR authority related to increases in external fees.

Volume change: A department may generally spend up to 125% of the forecast revenues that result from volume change. When a department needs to adjust its VNR authority because of volume change above 125% of its estimated revenues, it must seek approval from the Expenditures Management Sector of the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.
Rate change: If an increase is related to a rate change in optional or mandatory services, the department must seek approval through a Treasury Board submission.
New activity: If an increase is related to a new activity, the department must seek approval through a Treasury Board submission.



Under paragraph 32(1)(d) of the Financial Administration Act, departments can enter into commitments after the Estimates or the Interim Estimates are tabled in Parliament. The unencumbered balance includes estimated revenues. Departments can also enter into commitments for revenues received in excess of the amount set out in the Estimates or in the supply bill to the Interim Estimates if:

the revenues have been collected as noted under subsection 4.2.1 of the Guide to Delegating and Applying Spending and Financial Authorities
there is a sufficient unencumbered balance

5.3.6
Rights and privileges

Where the government goods and services being provided are for rights and privileges, revenues from these activities generally cannot be respent via a VNR authority or a revolving fund. Examples of rights and privileges include permits, licences or other authorizations. In addition, departments cannot respend revenues that exceed the cost of generating those associated revenues.

5.4 Special purpose money
5.4.1
Special purpose money as described in section 21 of the Financial Administration Act

""Special purpose money"" is money received or collected from an outside party (that is, external to the Government of Canada) for a special purpose and deposited in the Consolidated Revenue Fund pursuant to subsection 17(1) of the Financial Administration Act. Under subsection 4.12.1 of the directive, departments must seek approval from the Receiver General before they accept special purpose money. The money may be disbursed only for the purpose specified in the instrument under which it is received (for example, an act, a trust, a treaty or a contract). There is a direct link between monies received and monies disbursed, including any interest that may be authorized.

Special purpose money may be received through partnerships, joint projects, cost-sharing projects or similar arrangements with private sector organizations or other levels of government. Examples of special purpose money include gifts, donations, bequests and endowment funds.
Footnote
4

A cost-sharing project is a common undertaking whereby the parties involved agree to participate in carrying out a project. This undertaking may involve the sharing of resources, the purchasing of goods or services, and the hiring of personnel.

Funds deposited in a specified purpose account do not lapse at year-end as the appropriation authorities governing such accounts are statutory authorities (as opposed to annual appropriations) under subsection 21(1) of the Financial Administration Act.

5.4.2
Recording special purpose money in specified purpose accounts (SPA)

""Specified purpose accounts""
Footnote
5 is a broad classification of accounts reported in the Public Accounts of Canada. These accounts are used to record transactions and expenditures payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under statutory authorities established for specified purposes. Special purpose money can be recorded in a SPA only if the Receiver General has approved the creation of the SPA. Special purpose money is recorded as a liability in the Public Accounts.

Special purpose money, regardless of the source, is managed as public money. Accordingly, all regulations, policies and directives relating to the control of receipts and expenditures apply to funds received, credited and paid out for a specified purpose.

There are 2 types of SPAs:

SPAs that record the receipt and use of special purpose money: These SPAs are usually established operationally and record obligations and expenditures for money received by the Crown for a special purpose, in accordance with:
paragraph (d) of the definition of ""public money"" in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act
subsection 21(1) of the Financial Administration Act
SPAs that do not record special purpose money: These SPAs may involve joint ventures, partnerships, and insurance and benefit programs, and may only be established by legislation to record transactions and expenditures under specific statutory programs. These SPAs are not within the scope of the directive. More information is provided in Appendix B to this guide.



The goods and services tax (GST) / harmonized sales tax (HST) payable on expenditures charged to SPAs are generally charged to the SPAs instead of to the GST/HST refundable advance accounts (with a few exceptions). More information is provided in subsection 9.1.4 of the Financial Information Strategy Accounting Manual.

More information on the accounting treatment of SPAs is available in the Directive on Accounting Standards: GC 4100 Specified Purpose Accounts.

5.4.3
Establishing SPAs

Under subsection 4.12.1 of the directive, departments must obtain approval from the Receiver General to establish a SPA before they accept special purpose money. A SPA to record special purpose money is opened only when all of the following conditions are met:

There is an authority to receive or collect the funds. The authority under which the money is to be received or collected is the act, trust, treaty, undertaking or contract.
The special purpose activity is within the department’s mandate, in accordance with subsection 4.13 of the directive.
A liability or an obligation exists to the outside party to spend money and comply with the provisions of an agreement, a will or other unilateral transaction.
There is a direct link between the money received or collected from the outside party and the amount to be disbursed, and the purpose for which the money will be disbursed is known at the time of receipt.
No additional amounts, other than interest, are to be paid by or charged to the federal government as part of the arrangement for the special purpose money.
No payment of statutory benefits to an outside party is intended or anticipated (for example, a government program is not involved).



When establishing a SPA, the primary financial control objective is to ensure that special purpose money is segregated from all other funds (that is, voted appropriations) and that payments are restricted to third parties or other government departments, in accordance with subsection 4.12.2 of the directive. To maintain control of this unique source of funds and its use, funds must be segregated and accounted for separately from all other sources and uses of spending authority.

To determine whether the establishment of a SPA meets all the requirements, arrangements must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. To establish a SPA, the department must submit a formal request to the Receiver General, in accordance with Receiver General Directive 2009-2. The request is also shared with the Office of the Comptroller General. Once both parties are satisfied, the request form should be signed by the department’s chief financial officer and resubmitted to the Receiver General for official approval to establish the account.

5.4.4
Monitoring special purpose money

Departments should undertake periodic reviews and audits of their use of SPAs to ensure that they are established and operated within the scope of departmental authorities and in accordance with the directive. Particular attention should be given to the proper use of authorities and to the legal aspects of contracts, agreements and any other types of arrangements whereby funds would be received for a specified purpose. Other important aspects include the managers’ understanding of the appropriate authorities and their use, and the quality of documentation (for example, legal agreements, accounting records, and training documents for managers).

Adequate internal controls, including monitoring and periodic reconciliation, should be in place. For example, a complete audit trail should be in place to permit the tracing of all transactions related to the SPA. All details about the subsidiary accounts should be kept and reconciled monthly with the total liability balance of the SPA in the Public Accounts of Canada.

5.4.5
Considerations when using SPAs
5.4.5.1
Separation between SPAs and appropriated funds

To maintain effective controls on spending, special purpose money must be kept separate from funds that are appropriated by Parliament. Funding sourced from the fiscal framework or approved by Parliament cannot be transferred to a SPA. The unused portion of an appropriation that would otherwise lapse must not be recorded in a SPA. Similarly, funds received and deposited in a SPA cannot be transferred to a department’s voted appropriations.

5.4.5.2
Use of special purpose money

Special purpose money cannot be transferred to offset expenditures funded by a department’s voted appropriations for day-to-day operations (for example, salaries of indeterminate employees). However, special purpose money can be used to hire consultants or contract personnel if:

they are specifically hired to carry out the special purpose activity
payment for these services is charged directly to the SPA and not to the department’s voted appropriations
5.4.5.3
Cost recovery

Special purpose money should not be used to replace or avoid the authorities required for cost-recovery activities (for example, where fees for goods, services or the use of facilities would normally be charged to an outside party). However, a department that receives special purpose money can use the services of another department that has special revenue spending authority (for example, vote netted revenue or revolving funds) to carry out or supply the special purpose activity.

5.4.5.4
Interest

Interest on special purpose money deposited in a SPA may be authorized by specific statute or, in the absence of such authority, allowed under subsection 21(2) of the Financial Administration Act, at rates fixed by the Minister of Finance and approved by the Governor in Council.

5.4.5.5
Administration costs

When authorized by the enabling authority (for example, an act, a trust, a treaty or a contract), administration costs may be charged to a SPA. However, where the legislation or other establishing authority does not authorize the cost of administration to be charged to the account, costs incurred by the department for the administration of the funds held in a SPA must be charged to a departmental appropriation.

5.4.5.6
Insufficient funds in a SPA

No disbursements should be made from a SPA if there are insufficient funds at the time of payment. Accounts should not go into a negative (debit) balance unless authorized by legislation.

5.4.6
Closing a SPA

Under subsection 4.12.3 of the directive, once the purpose for which the funds were received has been realized:

the balance of the account must be returned to the person who paid it, in accordance with the Repayment of Receipt Regulations
if, in accordance with the act, trust, treaty or contract, there is no obligation to return the funds, the balance of the account must be transferred to a miscellaneous non-tax revenue account in the Consolidated Revenue Fund
5.5 Receipts that are respendable

Under subsection 4.14 of the directive, receipts must be credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund as non-respendable revenues unless there is a special financial authority (for example, revolving funds, vote netted revenue or special purpose money).

Receipts may not be credited to a department’s appropriation if they are for revolving funds or if they are special purpose money. However, if a department has vote netted revenue authority and there is clearly stated wording in the authority, receipts can be credited to a department’s appropriation. If the department does not have vote netted revenue authority, receipts may not be credited to the department’s appropriation.

A department may credit receipts to an appropriation for the purposes listed in section 39 of the Financial Administration Act, as described in subsection A.2 of Appendix A to the directive. No additional authorities need to be requested in order to credit the appropriation under section 39.

5.5.1
Authority to credit an appropriation pursuant to section 39 of the Financial Administration Act

Receipts may be credited to an appropriation if they are charged in the same fiscal year as the related expenditure, advance or payment, and if they apply to one of the following situations, as listed in subsection A.2.2.2 of Appendix A to the directive:

recovery of an overpayment to a supplier
recovery of a duplicate payment issued to a supplier
recovery of an erroneous payment to a supplier
recovery of delinquent account travel card charges that are paid on behalf of the cardholder by the department and recovered from the cardholder or employee
repayment of an accountable advance
repayment of a repayable contribution as described in the Directive on Transfer Payments
refund from the return of goods
refund of sales or excise taxes and custom duties
refund of an advance payment
refund resulting from the settlement of contractual disputes
refund resulting from a manufacturer’s rebate, price reduction, volume discount or other price adjustment
refund resulting from a landlord’s rebate representing cash lease incentive where a government department is a lessee
payment received further to an indemnification
payment received following a claim for loss of or damage to a Crown asset
rebate resulting from contractual arrangements
reimbursement from an organization for its agreed share of costs further to a cost-sharing arrangement (see subsection 5.5.2)
repayment of travel expenses such as personal stopovers and side trips, for which charges were included in a departmental invoice but that are the responsibility of the employee or traveller
repayment by employees of expenses of a personal nature such as cellular telephone charges for which payment was made by the department
5.5.2
Cost-sharing arrangements with a third party

Departments can enter into cost-sharing arrangements with a third party for various reasons. A third party is any person or organization that is not a department as defined in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act (for example, a municipality, a provincial government, a territory, a university, a person or a private sector organization).

Cost-sharing arrangements are treated on a case-by-case basis. Departments should consult:

their legal counsel to confirm whether there is an existing legal authority
Financial Management Enquiries at fin-www@tbs-sct.gc.ca about the appropriate accounting treatment of these transactions
5.6 Other government department suspense accounts

This subsection outlines how financial resources are managed when one department acts on behalf of another. More information on the accounting treatment of other government department (OGD) suspense accounts is provided in subsection 9.9 of the Financial Information Strategy Accounting Manual.

5.6.1
Administering another department’s program

Under subsection 4.15.1 of the directive, an OGD suspense account may be used only when the administering department is delivering another department’s program or incurs expenditures for another department.

The administering department may not charge payments against an OGD suspense account and recover the funds at a later date. Under subsection 4.15.3 of the directive, a written agreement must be established to ensure that all relevant accountabilities are agreed to before transferring funds to the account. Under subsection 4.15.2 of the directive, an OGD suspense account balance must be zero at the end of the fiscal year, and the administering department must return any surplus funds to the other department. OGD suspense accounts are not allowed to have a negative (debit) balance.

In accordance with subsection 4.16.1 of the directive, senior departmental managers must confirm with the Privy Council Office that the nature, materiality and duration of the planned arrangement do not warrant a change in the machinery of government. Departments may contact their departmental program sector analyst at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat for guidance."
