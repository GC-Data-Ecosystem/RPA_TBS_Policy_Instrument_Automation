1. Effective date,"1.1

This version of the guidelines incorporates updates effective April 1, 2022."
2. Purpose,"2.1

To provide guidance to managers and functional specialists on the identification, collection, reporting and publication of contract information."
3. Context,"3.1

As part of Canada’s second Action Plan on Open Government, the Government of Canada has committed to the disclosure of contracting data via a centralized, machine-readable database available to the public. This commitment reinforces the proactive disclosure of contracts which reflects broader government commitments to transparency and strengthened accountability within the public sector originally announced in Budget 2004.

3.2

Contracting data is gathered for the purposes of:

Strengthening transparency of the procurement process for Canadians to hold their government to account;
Meeting trade agreement procurement reporting obligations; and
Evaluating policy instruments.
3.3

These guidelines support the Directive on the Management of Procurement. Appendix C.2.1 requires the senior designated officials for the management of procurement to proactively publish contract information in accordance with Part 2 of the Access to Information Act. Appendix C.2.3 also requires departments to report on the contract data elements in the data format prescribed by the Treasury Board Secretariat.

3.4

These guidelines also support the public disclosure of contract information requirements for government entities and Ministers’ offices under the Access to Information Act. Sections 77 and 86 of the Act requires Ministers’ offices and government entities to publicly disclose contracts with a value of over $10,000, a contract amendment when it modifies the contract value to exceed $10,000 and amendments to contracts that increase or decrease the value of the contract by more than $10,000."
4. Guidelines,"4.1 Identification of contracts to be proactively disclosed
4.1.1

Appendix C.2.4.1 of the Directive on the Management of Procurement requires quarterly public disclosure of the following:

A contract when its value is over $10,000;
A positive or negative amendment when its value is over $10,000; and
A positive amendment when it modifies the initial value of a contract to an amended contract value that is over $10,000.
4.1.2

Appendix C.2.5 of the Directive on the Management of Procurement, requires annual reporting, on a calendar year basis, to Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) via email (ncr.gwprs@pwgsc.gc.ca and cc: ZZPDCDC@tbs-sct.gc.ca) on the following:

A contract when its value is $10,000 and under; and
A positive or negative amendment when its value is $10,000 and under.
4.1.3

Appendix C.2.4.2 of the Directive on the Management of Procurement requires annual public disclosure, on a calendar year basis, on the volume and cumulative dollar value of a contract or positive or negative amendment when its value is $10,000 or less. In addition, the disclosure of the volume and cumulative dollar value of all acquisition card transactions regardless of dollar value is required.

4.1.4

A series of amendments to a contract made in one reporting period may be disclosed as one amendment. Alternatively, an amendment may be reported separately if this is the standard practice in the department.

4.1.5

Non-financial amendments do not need to be disclosed, except when it is in the public interest to do so.

4.1.6

A contract option, when exercised, may be disclosed as an amendment. Alternatively, the full value of a contract, including options, may be disclosed at the time of contract award.

4.1.7

A call-up against a standing offer or supply arrangement should be disclosed as a contract.

4.1.8

A standing offer agreement and a supply arrangement agreement are not procurement contracts but are to be disclosed for the purpose of transparency. Such agreements must be disclosed either as part of proactive disclosure or on a public website.

4.1.9

For contracts with task authorizations
Footnote
1, the full potential value of the contract may be disclosed upon contract award unless the full value is not expected to be used. In the latter situation, each task authorization may be disclosed individually. When a contract includes a fixed deliverable and another deliverable that requires a task authorization, the department may disclose the contract and task authorizations in any manner that is transparent.

4.1.10

In accordance with Part 2 of the Access to Information Act, departments are required to disclose contracts or positive and negative amendments valued at over $10,000 with only very limited exceptions. A department is not required to disclose information about contracts that would properly be withheld in response to a request under Part 1 of the Access to Information Act pursuant to s.80 and s.90 of the Act.

4.1.11

When a department determines that information about a contract should properly be withheld from proactive disclosure under section 4.1.10 of these guidelines, the department is still required, per Part 2 of the Access to Information Act, to disclose those portions of contract information that do not contain or can reasonable be severed from information that may be withheld.

4.1.12

The following would usually be excluded from reporting, unless they constitute contracts under the Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments:

Information pertaining to Memoranda of understanding with other levels of government and foreign governments;
Information pertaining to service level agreements between federal departments or with Crown corporations.
4.2 Collection of contracting data elements
4.2.1

The data elements in appendices A and B were developed to provide consistency to the public. As a best practice, departments are encouraged to follow the recommended approach identified in appendices A and B for each data element if possible. If use of the recommended approach is not possible, a department may use a standard practice in the department for disclosure. To provide consistency to the public, it is recommended that departments move away from departmental standards and move towards the recommended reporting standard over time.

4.3 Publication and reporting of contracts
4.3.1

Starting for calendar year 2017, departments must report their contracting data on the Open Government Portal. When Public Services and Procurement Canada, Shared Services Canada (SSC) or another department or Crown corporation issues a contract on a department's behalf, the client department should report the contract. PSPC and SSC will assist client organizations by providing any information it has on such contracts through the Procurement Policy Division’s GCpedia site within five business days after the end of the quarter. In addition, the PSPC and SSC contracting authority is to provide a copy of each contract or amendment to the client department at time of award.

4.3.2

For PSPC or SSC multi-departmental contracts, departments are to disclose their portion only as either a contract or amendment based on how it was recorded in their departmental procurement or financial systems. For a standing offer agreement or supply arrangement agreement, it is recommended that the agreement be reported by the department that authorizes the agreement.

4.3.3

Reporting is to occur for:

Quarterly public disclosures of data elements as detailed in Appendix A for contracts and positive and negative amendments over $10,000, within 30 days after the end of the first three quarters of a fiscal year (April to June, July to September and October to December) and 60 days after the end of the fourth quarter.
Annual public disclosures of data elements as detailed in Appendix B for contracts and positive and negative amendments $10,000 and under, by May 30 of the following calendar year.
Annual reporting to PSPC of data elements as detailed in Appendix A for contracts and positive and negative amendments $10,000 and under, by May 30 of the following calendar year.
4.3.4

When the above dates for posting fall on a weekend or statutory holiday, departments may post information by the last business day before the weekend or holiday in question.

4.3.5

A contract or amendment not reported in the reporting period in which it was awarded may be reported in the subsequent reporting period, or as soon as practicable. Any contract or amendment included in a reporting period after its publication, should clearly indicate the omission within the comments data element (refer to Appendix C).

4.3.6

Information posted in one reporting period can be modified for that reporting period only when a material error was made in the data originally published. Any modified information is recommended to be clearly indicated as such within the comments data (refer to Appendix C).

4.3.7

Departments are to provide a nil report for any quarter or calendar year in which no contract or amendment is disclosed. Departments are to populate the reporting period and the nil report data elements within the reporting template.

4.3.8

Departments are to report on the data format under the new and revised Appendix A data fields as soon as administratively possible, but no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021/2022 for contracts and amendments awarded starting January 1, 2022. In the interim, departments are to continue to use the previous data format to report on the existing data fields until they are able to change to the new data format.

4.3.9

Departments and agencies listed in Appendix E are to include the new data elements identified in Appendix A, items 37 to 40 in the proactive disclosure reports on a pilot basis. It is recommended for departments to begin reporting on the data elements listed in Appendix E after departmental procurement or financial systems have implemented the required functionality. Treasury Board Secretariat will review the list of departments and agencies reporting on Appendix E on an ongoing basis for inclusion of remaining departments as they obtain the required functionality.

4.4 Monitoring of proactive disclosure
4.4.1

In accordance with 4.1.2.13 of the Directive on the Management of Procurement, senior designated officials for the management of procurement in departments and agencies are responsible for:

ensuring contracting information is accurate (including information publicly disclosed on the Open Government portal) to a level of materiality that is cost-efficient;
ensuring contracting information remains representative of actual contracting activity; and
validating and approving the timely publication of contracting information."
