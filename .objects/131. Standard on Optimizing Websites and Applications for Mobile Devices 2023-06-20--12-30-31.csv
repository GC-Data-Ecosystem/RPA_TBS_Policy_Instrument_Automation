3. Context,"3.1 Canadians are increasingly using mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to access Government of Canada information and services.

Departments continue to commission, fund and define requirements as well as develop and maintain content for device-based mobile applications.
Departments identified as Government of Canada Centres of Expertise on Mobile or external service providers design, develop, test and maintain device-based mobile applications, with the exception of device-based mobile applications that use secure logins.
The department that is mandated as the Government of Canada publishing entity independently tests, publishes and retires device-based mobile applications.
