1. Date of publication,"This guide was published on May 29, 2018, and incorporates changes effective as of December 1, 2020.

This guide replaces the provisions on claims in the Guideline on Claims and Ex Gratia Payments dated October 1, 2009."
"2. Application, purpose and scope","This guide applies to the organizations listed in section 6 of the Policy on Financial Management.

The purpose of this guide is to help departments manage claims against the Crown and claims by the Crown.

The guide supports the Directive on Payments and the Directive on Public Money and Receivables. It does not contain any new mandatory requirements for settling claims against or by the Crown. Examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and may not apply to all departments or situations.

Section 3 defines claims and sets out the principles of managing claims. It also highlights the importance of consulting departmental legal services when a claim is made against or by the Crown.

Section 4 explains the different types of claims and identifies when the Directive on Payments applies.

Sections 5 and 6 outline the processes for managing claims against and by the Crown.

Section 7 discusses the accounting treatment of claims."
3. Overview of claims,"3.1 Definition

The Directive on Payments defines a claim as a request for compensation to cover losses, expenditures or damages sustained by the Crown or by another party (the claimant).

3.2 Manager’s responsibilities

Managers who have been delegated authority to issue payments for claims against the Crown or who are considering making a claim by the Crown should:

make sure that the claim:
meets the definition of a claim as set out in the Directive on Payments (see subsection 3.1 of this guide)
is treated in accordance with existing authorities, governing instruments or policies, when applicable (see subsection 4 of this guide)
make every reasonable effort to obtain value for money when resolving the claim
consider the legal and other merits of the claim (see subsection 3.3 of this guide)
consider the administrative expediency and cost-effectiveness of making or settling the claim
reduce the amount of the payment for a claim against the Crown when the acts or omissions of any person, including persons for whom a payment is being considered, contributed to the damages or loss incurred (see subsection 5.1.6 of this guide)
3.3 Importance of obtaining a legal opinion

When an incident occurs, the delegated departmental manager is responsible for managing the risk associated with dealing with any claim that may arise between a department and other entities (for example, the claimant).

Because of the legal nature of claims, managers who are involved in a claim should always seek advice from their departmental legal services; however, in some situations, managers must consult them. For example, when a claim involves legal proceedings or when a payment of an amount greater than $25,000 is being considered, senior departmental managers must refer the claim to departmental legal services to determine whether any potential legal liability exists (as outlined in subsection A.2.2.2.2 of the Directive on Payments).

Claims involving Crown servants (either a claim against the Crown by Crown servants or a claim by the Crown against Crown servants) are generally negotiated by, or in conjunction with, the Department of Justice Canada, without recourse to the courts and according to the relevant authorities and procedures. “Crown servant” is defined in the Directive on Payments."
4. Types of claims,"This section describes the different types of claims and identifies when the requirements of the Directive on Payments apply. Claims must be treated in accordance with the applicable authorities, governing instruments or policies. As such:

chief financial officers are responsible for establishing procedures for claims covered by the Directive on Payments as well as those covered by other authorities, governing instruments or policies, such as those listed in Table 1 of section 4.6 (see subsection A.2.2.1.1.2 of the Directive on Payments).
managers with delegated authority to make payments for claims against the Crown must ensure that these payments are not covered by other authorities, governing instruments or policies (see subsection A.2.2.3.1.1 of the Directive on Payments).

For claims described in this section that are covered by other authorities, governing instruments or policies and not the Directive on Payments, managers can still refer to this guide when managing the claim because a number of the steps involved are applicable (for example, conducting an investigation, seeking a legal opinion).

4.1 Claims in contract

Claims in contract are to be dealt with according to the terms of the applicable contract and pursuant to the applicable law. Departments must ensure that the interests of the Crown are protected and that all legal rights are exercised. This type of claim is not governed by the Directive on Payments.

For example, a department cancels a contract with a supplier. The supplier files a claim for contract-related damages. The claim is contractual in nature and should be dealt with in accordance with the clauses outlined in the contract and the applicable law.

4.2 Claims in tort (or extra-contractual liability in Quebec)

Claims in tort, known as extra‑contractual liability claims in Quebec, are claims that do not arise in the context of a written, oral or implied contractual agreement. Claims in tort between the Crown and a claimant are subject to the requirements of the Directive on Payments.

For example, a federal government organization cut down a tree on federal property. When it fell, the tree damaged a neighbour’s personal property. The neighbour filed a claim for damages. That claim would be considered a claim in tort because the actions of the Crown resulted in losses of the neighbour’s personal property.

4.3 Claims between departments

As a general rule, one federal government department cannot claim damages and receive payment from another federal government department. Such claims are dealt with in a manner that precludes departments from seeking damages from each other (for example, on the basis of mutual forbearance).

4.4 Claims between departments and Crown corporations

Departments and Crown corporations use negotiated settlements to settle claims. However, when a claim is pursued, each party should voluntarily supply the other with all information in its possession. If the parties themselves cannot agree on the claim’s merits and liabilities, then the legal officers of both organizations should try to reach an agreement. If the legal officers cannot agree, then the matter is referred to the Deputy Attorney General of Canada for arbitration.

4.5 Claims under the Canadian Human Rights Act

Claims under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) are subject to the investigation and conciliation requirements under the CHRA. The negotiation and payment of settlements and tribunal orders under the CHRA are subject to the requirements of the Directive on Payments, except if they relate to complaints on equal pay for work of equal value lodged under section 11 of the CHRA. Those complaints are dealt with through Treasury Board policy instruments relating to people management and through other authorities.

4.6 Examples of claims covered by other authorities, governing instruments or policies

Table 1 lists examples of claims that are covered under other authorities, governing instruments or policies and not under the Directive on Payments. The instruments in the right hand column contain specific requirements for claims that arise in the situations listed in the left hand column. Note that this table is not exhaustive.

5. Claims against the Crown,"5.1 Process when a claim is filed against the Crown

Figure 1 shows the process to be followed when a claim is made against the Crown. Subsections 5.1.1 to 5.1.6 of this guide describe the key steps of this process in detail.

Figure 1: process when a claim is filed against the Crown
Figure 1 - Text version
5.1.1 Gather documentation

Under subsection A.2.2.2.1 of the Directive on Payments, when a claim is made against the Crown after an incident has occurred, senior departmental managers with delegated authority to make payments for claims against the Crown are responsible for, without prejudice and without admitting liability, obtaining original copies of documents and for obtaining details from the claimant, such as:

a detailed statement of the facts on which the claim is based
a detailed statement showing how the amount of the claim was calculated
documents confirming all disbursements
5.1.2 Conduct an investigation

An investigation should be conducted at the earliest reasonable opportunity. The delegated departmental manager should consider whether to request assistance from the departmental security officer, depending on the type of incident and the amount of the claim. The investigation should be formally documented.

The extent of the investigation depends on the type of incident, the amount of the claim and the potential cost of the investigation.

The investigation should include the following, as applicable:

a full statement of the duties and responsibilities of any Crown servant involved
details about the use of any Crown property involved and the authority for that use
signed statements about the incident from Crown servants and other persons with knowledge of the circumstances
copies of any reports made to the police in connection with the incident
a complete account of the incident, including who was involved, what happened, where it happened, when it happened, how it happened and why it happened
plans, sketches or photographs, as necessary, to contextualize or explain the nature and extent of the incident
any additional information and material that may be required for a legal opinion
the assistance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
the assistance of private sector claims adjustment services or collection agencies

The department’s security officials are generally responsible for:

conducting or directing investigations into claims, or assisting managers in this regard, unless the department has a dedicated section established for this purpose
dealing with the appropriate law enforcement agency, if necessary
5.1.3 Determine whether a legal opinion is required

Managers should determine whether a legal opinion is required. The decision will be based on the magnitude and the complexity of the situation. See subsection 3.3 of this guide for more information.

If the manager determines that a legal opinion is required, the manager refers the claim to departmental legal services and sends them the formal documentation from the investigation (see subsection 5.1.2 of this guide) and any information received from the claimant (see subsection 5.1.1 of this guide).

The legal opinion should address the following:

whether the Crown has any potential legal liability
the steps, if any, to be taken to resolve the claim
the terms and conditions on which it would be advisable to resolve the claim, when it is advisable to settle
5.1.4 Determine whether there is a legal liability for the Crown

If the legal opinion identifies a potential legal liability for the Crown, the delegated departmental manager should take the following steps to settle the claim, in accordance with subsection A.2.2.3.1 of the Directive on Payments:

determine the amount(s) to be paid
assess the administrative expediency and cost effectiveness of making the payment

If the legal opinion indicates that the Crown has no legal liability, the delegated departmental manager may decide, in consultation with departmental legal services, to settle the claim or deny the claim. The opinion could be used as a justification for the denial of the claim, and the delegated departmental manager would inform the claimant of the denial.

5.1.5 Obtain a release

In accordance with subsection A.2.2.2.4 of the Directive on Payments, when the Crown is to issue a payment to settle claim, the senior departmental manager obtains a signed release from the claimant, as required. An example of a release form is provided in Appendix B of this guide. Departmental legal services can also provide guidance on what to include in a release form.

5.1.6 Issue payment

In accordance with subsection A.2.2.3.1 of the Directive on Payments, when deciding whether to make a payment for a claim against the Crown, delegated departmental managers must:

validate that there are no existing authorities, governing instruments or policies
assess the legal or other merits of the claim
negotiate an appropriate amount, including considering whether to offer a lesser amount when the acts or omissions of any person, including persons for whom a payment is being considered, contributed to the damages or loss incurred
5.2 Claims against the Crown by Crown servants

This section describes the process to follow for claims made against the Crown by Crown servants. This guide does not apply to Crown servants’ claims against the Crown that are covered by other authorities, governing instruments or policies. For example:

claims and legal proceedings covered by the Policy on Legal Assistance and Indemnification
claims under section 11 of the Equal Wages Guidelines
claims for damages to Crown servants’ effects while on relocation or travel status; these claims are covered in instruments such as the National Joint Council’s NJC Relocation Directive and the Travel Directive
claims related to bodily injury while on duty; these claims are covered in the Government Employees Compensation Act
5.2.1 Claims for Crown servants’ effects

Under subsection A.2.2.2.3 of the Directive on Payments, senior departmental managers are responsible for conducting an investigation of reported incidents for claims of a Crown servant that include personal property that is damaged, lost, stolen or destroyed while in the performance of the Crown servant’s duties. This investigation is to be conducted with the assistance of the departmental security officials as required. See section 5.1.2 of this guide for more information on conducting an investigation.

When a Crown servant makes a claim against the Crown following an incident in which the Crown servant’s effects were damaged, lost, stolen or destroyed, the delegated departmental manager must investigate and consult with their departmental legal services to determine if there is any potential liability. The following criteria apply:

Crown servants’ effects include only items considered to be reasonably related to the performance of the Crown servant’s duties at the time of the loss or damage
Compensation is based on the full cost to replace the effects with the same or equivalent quality or the reasonable cost for repair"
6. Claims by the Crown,"6.1 Process when a claim is filed by the Crown

Managers must make every reasonable effort to obtain value for money when resolving claims by the Crown. They should consider the administrative costs, level of effort, and cost‑effectiveness in pursuing the claim.

Figure 2 shows the process to be followed when a claim is filed by the Crown. Subsections 6.1.1 to 6.1.4 of this guide describe the key steps of this process in detail.

Figure 2: process when a claim is filed by the Crown
Figure 2 - Text version
6.1.1 Investigate and document the incident

When an incident occurs, delegated departmental managers must investigate and document the incident. See section 5.1.2 of this guide for more information on conducting an investigation.

6.1.2 Seek a legal opinion

In compliance with subsection A.2.2.2.2.1 of the Directive on Payments, senior departmental managers must refer all claims by the Crown that involve legal proceedings to their departmental legal services.

In addition, senior departmental managers must obtain a legal opinion when:

there is conflicting evidence or a lack of evidence
there is uncertainty about which legal principles apply
6.1.3 Sign a release

As a condition of receiving a payment to resolve a claim by the Crown, both the manager with delegated authority to resolve claims and the party against whom the claim was made may be asked to sign a release form. The manager should ask departmental legal services to review the release before signing it.

6.1.4 Initiate recovery action

When pursuing a recovery action resulting from a claim by the Crown, the collection process must be consistent with the requirements of the Directive on Public Money and Receivables, including that timely and cost-effective collection actions are taken to pursue the recovery.

6.2 Claims by the Crown against Crown servants

Generally, claims by the Crown against Crown servants in relation to incidents involving work-related activities are negotiated without recourse to the courts, in accordance with the relevant authorities and procedures.

When a Crown servant is not covered under the Policy on Legal Assistance and Indemnification, the manager can seek recovery of funds from any money due to the Crown servant from the Crown after:

notifying the Crown servant of the proposed retention of money due to them by the Crown and of their right to make representation (for example, the Crown servant has the option to present their perspective on the claim and its recovery) within 30 days
considering the Crown servant’s representation before making a final decision"
7. Reporting,"7.1 Claims against the Crown

Once a claim against the Crown is known, the potential financial obligation is to be assessed and accounted for in line with the Directive on Accounting Standards: GC 3300-3310 Contingent Liabilities and Loan Guarantees.

All payments of claims against the Crown are to be reported in the Public Accounts in the fiscal year in which the payment is made. See the Public Accounts of Canada instructions of the Receiver General Manual for more information.

7.2 Claims by the Crown

Once a claim by the Crown is initiated, the potential financial asset is to be assessed and accounted for in line with the Directive on Accounting Standards: GC3320 Contingent Assets.

All payments anticipated to be received as a result of a claim by the Crown should be accounted for by following the directions provided in the Financial Information Strategy Accounting Manual."
