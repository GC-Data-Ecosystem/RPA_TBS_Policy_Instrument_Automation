5. Policy requirements,"Note: The definitions in Appendix A apply throughout this policy.

5.1 School fees

When the adequate educational facility requires that non-resident school fees be paid for the child's education, the deputy head must not reimburse an amount that is higher than the school authority ordinarily charges for a non-resident student.

5.2 Transportation

The deputy head may, under the following circumstances, assist with the cost of daily transportation to and from an educational facility: the school authority does not provide adequate transportation and the educational facility is located more than eight kilometres from the child's residence, and the cost exceeds $3 per month per child or $5 per month for two or more children of the same family. The forms of assistance are:

reimbursement of the cost that exceeds the limits stated above for using public, non-urban transportation;
providing a chartered or Crown-owned vehicle or taxi for transportation. The employee must contribute to the cost of this transportation, up to the limits stated above. This charge will be suspended if the child is absent from school two weeks or more for a recognized cause; or
where none of the above means of transportation are available, employees may, upon request and with the deputy head's approval, receive a kilometric allowance each day they transport their children to and from the adequate educational facility. The allowance is equal to the return distance between the employee's home and the educational facility times the traveller-requested rates as provided by the Travel Directive.
5.3 Board and lodging
The deputy head reimburses costs for board and lodging only where:
no suitable daily transportation is available;
the cost is less than that of daily transportation; or
daily transportation is not feasible because of time, distance or terrain.
Before authorizing reimbursement for meals, the deputy head should consider the normal food costs the employee incurs when the child lives at home.
5.4 Travel expenses

Where a deputy head has authorized a child's board and lodging away from the employee's place of residence, the employee is entitled to reimbursement of eligible travel expenses when the child returns to the employee's place of duty during a school holiday. Eligible expenses are actual and reasonable transportation and travelling expenses the child incurs for two return trips each school year, between the employee's place of duty and adequate educational facility. If the employee has elected to send the child to a different school, the deputy head must reimburse only the amount that would be eligible if the child were attending the adequate educational facility.

5.5 Tutoring fees
5.5.1 Subjects

Deputy heads may reimburse expenses for tutoring fees:

in subjects where the child's educational level is below that of the new educational facility and where the school authority feels the deficiency is directly attributable to the circumstances of the parent's previous location(s) of employment;
for subjects the previous educational facility attended by the child does not normally offer but the educational facility in question does;
for subjects the province or territory of residence normally offers but the educational facility that the child must attend in question does not.
5.5.2 Official Languages

Where adequate educational facilities are available but the curriculum is offered only in the child's second official language, and the employee elects to send the child to that educational facility, the deputy head may, in certain cases, reimburse the cost of extracurricular courses or tutors to instruct the child in the educational facility's official language of instruction. The employee must however show evidence that the local school authorities at the employee's place of residence have interviewed the child either before or after the transfer and concur that the child would avoid losing academic standing if the courses or tutors were provided.

5.6 Other costs

The deputy head may authorize the payment of fees, expenses and charges for courses, instructions, services, programs, books and materials normally provided, without additional cost to the family, as part of the educational program of the province or territory of residence but not provided at the approved adequate educational facility the child attends.

5.7 Payment of costs in the Yukon Territories

In accordance with Order in Council 1962-17/1371, deputy heads with employees residing in the Yukon Territory must pay the Government of the Yukon Territory $350 per school year for each child who attends an educational facility operated by the Government of the Yukon Territory and is a dependant of a federal government employee occupying non-taxable quarters. The payment should be applied to the operation and maintenance of the educational facility."
