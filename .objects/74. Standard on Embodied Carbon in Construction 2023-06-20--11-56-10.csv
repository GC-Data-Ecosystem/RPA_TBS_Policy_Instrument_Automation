1. Preamble,"1.1

This standard is issued pursuant to the same authorities indicated in section 4 of the Policy on Green Procurement, and is consistent with the Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments and the Directive on the Management of Procurement.

Embodied carbon forms a significant proportion of the whole life carbon emissions from construction projects. This standard sets minimum requirements for the procurement of design and construction services to disclose and reduce the embodied carbon of major construction projects. Major construction projects typically include the renovation or new construction of buildings or engineering assets.

The objective of this standard is to establish requirements to disclose and reduce the embodied carbon footprint of construction projects in accordance with the commitments in the Greening Government Strategy."
2. Effective date,"2.1
This standard takes effect on December 31, 2022.
2.2
Procurements commenced after the effective date are required to apply this standard."
3. Standards,"3.1
This standard provides details on the requirements set out in subsections 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 of the Policy on Green Procurement and the commitments in the Greening Government Strategy.
3.2

Organizations described in section 3 of the Policy on Green Procurement must:

3.2.1
Adhere to Appendix A, which sets out specific conditions, including effective dates, project value thresholds and reduction targets, in relation to the disclosure of and reductions in the embodied carbon footprint of construction projects;
3.2.2

Include the following requirements in the procurement of design services:

3.2.2.1
Disclose the carbon footprint of structural materials in accordance with Appendix A;
3.2.2.2
Reduce the carbon footprint of structural materials in accordance with Appendix A;
3.2.2.3
Ensure that structural materials are specified by a professional engineer registered or licensed in the province or territory where the project will be implemented; and
3.2.2.4
Review the completed Embodied Carbon Disclosure Template (refer to Appendix B) before project completion to ensure compliance with subsections 3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.2 of this standard;
3.2.3

Include the following requirements in the procurement of construction services:

3.2.3.1
Ensure that the Embodied Carbon Disclosure Template (refer to Appendix B) is secured by the organization before project completion, and that it lists the required information for each type of material identified in Appendix A;
3.2.3.2

Disclose the embodied carbon footprint of structural materials measured in global warming potential (GWP) with Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) that:

3.2.3.2.1
Reference the material supplier’s name or professional association as a contributor;
3.2.3.2.2
Comply with international standards noted in Appendix A within the period of validity; and
3.2.3.2.3
Are produced using the highest available resolution life cycle inventory (LCI) data as noted in Appendix A;
3.2.3.3
Where EPDs are not readily available, provide a life cycle assessment (LCA) report that complies with international standards (International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14044, ISO 14025, and ISO 21930 or equivalent) and that is verified by an LCA reviewer as such a report is considered an acceptable equivalent form of disclosure; and
3.2.4
Submit to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, at the time of the annual call letter of the Greening Government Strategy, a consolidated report that details the embodied carbon footprint for all construction projects completed in the previous fiscal year that meet or exceed the thresholds identified in Appendix A. This information may be used for other reporting obligations under the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy."
4. Application,"4.1

This standard applies to:

4.1.1
Organizations described in section 3 of the Policy on Green Procurement; and
4.1.2
Any new construction or renovation of real property in Canada at or above the thresholds listed in Appendix A at the time of solicitation of design services.
4.2

This standard does not apply:

4.2.1
If the specified quantities of a structural material are below the minimum quantity threshold, or the project value is below the minimum threshold, as identified in Appendix A; or
4.2.2
If the project is in a geographic area excluded from a requirement, as identified in Appendix A.
4.3
Subsection 3.2.2.2 of this standard may not apply to a project if the required performance of a structural material hinders the implementation of the subsection or if a material is not available in a given region. If subsection 3.2.2.2 does not apply, an exemption rationale must be secured (refer to Appendix C). Projects exempt from subsection 3.2.2.2 must still disclose the embodied carbon of structural materials in accordance with subsection 3.2.2.1 of this standard, and reduce their embodied carbon to the greatest extent feasible."
