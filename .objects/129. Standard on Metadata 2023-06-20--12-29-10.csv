3.2 Metadata defines and describes the structure and meaning of information resources, and the context and systems in which they exist. It is used to support efficient and effective management of these information resources over time.

3.3  The consistent creation, capture and use of metadata contribute to the objectives of the Policy on Information Management and the Directive on Recordkeeping to manage information as a strategic asset by supporting the capture, description, retrieval, use, re-use, accessibility, sharing, authenticity, reliability, integrity, and maintenance of information resources to facilitate decision-making, accountability, and the efficient delivery of Government programs and services.

3.4  Standardized metadata in the design, documentation and implementation of systems and components supports interoperability within and across systems, and re-use of information resources within departments and across the Government of Canada (GC) to the extent that government laws and policies permit it.

3.5 Along with standardized metadata, consistent use of value domains supports the exchange of information resources within and across systems. Value domains include, but are not limited to, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies, thesauri, reference data, authority lists, naming conventions, and value string instructions.

3.6 The requirements of this standard apply to the following domains:

3.6.1 Recordkeeping: Recordkeeping metadata supports recordkeeping as a management function through which information resources of business value are created, acquired, captured, and managed in departmental repositories over time, and used as a strategic asset to support effective decision making and facilitate ongoing operations and the delivery of programs and services.

3.6.2 Web resource discovery: Web resource discovery metadata supports the navigation, searching, display and sharing of Web information resources.

3.6.3 Web content management systems: Web content management system (WCMS) metadata supports business and technical processes for authoring, managing and publishing Web content in Web content management systems.

3.7 A related standard, the Standard on Geospatial Data, establishes requirements for geospatial metadata.

3.8 This standard is issued pursuant to section 7 of the Financial Administration Act.
